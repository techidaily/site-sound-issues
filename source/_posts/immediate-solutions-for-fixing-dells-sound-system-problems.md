 When the connections are fine, but the Astro A50 no sound issue persists, you can try the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Set your Astro A50 as the default

 Next, you need to**check if your headset is properly configured on Windows** .

#### 1\. Check Volume mixer settings

![open volume mixer](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-volume-mixer.jpg)
2. Make sure all the entries set at an appropriate level. In my case, I set headphones and my applications to 100.

4. Test the audio.

If the problem remains, you can move on to the next method.

## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

### Option 2: Update your sound card driver automatically (Recommended)
