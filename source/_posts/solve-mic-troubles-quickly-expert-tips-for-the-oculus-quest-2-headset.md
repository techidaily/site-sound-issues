## Fix 1: Perform some basic troubleshooting

 Whether it is that you cannot hear voice from the other end, or you can’t get heard, the first thing you should check is whether your headset is connected properly.

 You should make sure the volume is set to an audible level, check that the adapter you use to connect your headset to the PC (such as bluetooth, Micro USB port or the Xbox dongle) is in working condition.

 SteelSeries Arctis 9/9X also has a hardware reset switch that allows you to reset the headphone. Press it and hold it down for around 1 second.
