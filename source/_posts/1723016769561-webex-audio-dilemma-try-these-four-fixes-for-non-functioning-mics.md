 If your sound starts working again, then you should have found and fixed your problem.

If your sound is not working, try the following solutions.

### Fix 2: Check the hardware problem

Your hardware issues can cause your sound not working on PC.

#### 1\. Check the speaker on your computer

 Simply take a look at the speaker on your computer and see whether there is anything covering upon the speaker, which could cause no sound on your computer. Make sure there is no dust or cloth that can cover the sound on your computer.

#### 2\. Check the headphone jack

 You should check the headphone jack if you’re connecting headphone to your PC. Look inside the headphone jack see if there is any obstacle that may stop the headphone from working properly.

 If there is, clean the jacks with a cotton swab or soft brush. Push it into the jack and swirl it around a little bit to get the dust and lint out.

#### 3\. Check your headset

 If your PC is connecting to your headphone, you should also take a look at your headphone to make sure that the devices are working normally.

 You can disconnect your headphone, then see there is any sound from your PC. If yes, it seems to be an issue with your headset, so you can replace with a headphone that works.

 If your sound is still not working, it should be a problem with your PC. Continue with the methods below.

### Fix 4: Update your sound card driver

 If your sound card driver is missing or outdated, you’ll have the sound problems on PC, so you should update your sound card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your audio card manufacturer, find the latest correct driver for your sound card, then download and install it manually into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff38bc0d8a.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff3a386818.jpg)
4. Restart your computer to take effect.
