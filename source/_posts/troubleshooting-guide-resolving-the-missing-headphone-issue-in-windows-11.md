Before you start, make sure your headset is working properly.

## Try these fixes

 These fixes have helped many people. Because of the different devices and environments, you may need to work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The Windows 11 no sound issue and other audio issues are usually caused by drivers. Outdated drivers or missing drivers are the reason for many PC problems. To fix it, you need to find the latest and compatible driver for your devices.

 You can update the audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website and downloading the correct driver. Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.
