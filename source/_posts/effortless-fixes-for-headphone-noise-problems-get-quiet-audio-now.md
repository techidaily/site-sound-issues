### **Fix 2: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

 Having **Exclusive Mode**   on means the specific app will take full control while in use so that other apps cannot play audio through the device. But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the **crackling or popping sound** in headphone  problem. To disable **Exclusive Mode** :

 1) On the bottom right of your screen, right-click on**the sound icon** , then click**Sounds** .

 2) In the**Playback** tab, right-click on**speakers** and click **Properties** .

 3) Click the**Advanced** tab, un-check **the box** before **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** . Then click **Apply** \> **OK** .

 4) Play some music and check if the sound coming through is noise-free now. If not, continue with **5)** to **change the audio format** .

 5) Still in the**Advanced** tab, select **16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)** . Then click **Apply** \> **OK** .
