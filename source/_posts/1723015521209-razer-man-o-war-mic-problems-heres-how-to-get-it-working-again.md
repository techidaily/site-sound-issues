If you’re using a Corsair headset but it’s not working as expected, i.e. no sound or the microphone not functioning, you’re not alone. This type of issue is usually caused by the improper settings, an outdated audio driver or firmware. But don’t worry. This post will show you all the easy & quick solutions.

## Fix 2 – Update your audio driver

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .
