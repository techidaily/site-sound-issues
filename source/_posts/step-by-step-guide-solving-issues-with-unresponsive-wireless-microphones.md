## Fix 1 – Allow access to your microphone on your PC

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings, then select**Privacy** .

3. Check to see if the toggle in the**Allow apps to access your microphone** section is turned**On** . If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.

## Fix 5 – Use a USB audio card

 If your computer’s sound card is defective or if your laptop/desktop system has a faulty 3.5mm audio port, the Corsair HS35 mic may not be able to work properly. If that is the case, you might think about using a USB Audio Card, which is an external sound device that can **bypass problems in your built-in sound card and regain the audio function for you** .
