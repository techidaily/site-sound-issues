If this doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 Audio issues can arise if you’re using an**outdated audio driver** . To fix the Discord echo problem, you should give updating the audio driver a try. This may be the best shot you can take without much troubleshooting. You can update your audio driver manually using the Device Manager utility in Windows or go to your sound card manufacturer to search for driver updates.
