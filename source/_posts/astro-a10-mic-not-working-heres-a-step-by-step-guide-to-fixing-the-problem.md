 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer. The reset button varies on different Jabra headsets, but normally you could**hold the multi-function button for around 10 seconds** to clear the settings.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .

If restoring your computer still failed, there is the last method to try.

## Fix 5 – Update the firmware

1. Download **[Jabra Direct](https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/jabra-direct)**  and launch the app.
2. Connect your Jabra headset to the computer and it should be automatically detected by the program.
3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/firmware-update-1.jpg)
4. Select the language you prefer and click**Update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/firmware-update-2.jpg)
5. Click**Ok** when the update completes.

 Now that both the headset software and firmware are updated, your Jarba headset should be working without trouble.
