## Before we move further…

 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

2. Restart your computer and your Jabra headset, then try the connection again.
3. Make sure that your Jabra headset is fully charged.
4. Make sure that your computer and Jabra headset are still in Bluetooth range and connected.
5. Try to reset your Jabra headset to its default status, then try the connection again.

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your computer is corrupted, faulty or outdated, a headset may not connect to the PC or work correctly. You may find the mic is malfunctioning or there’s no sound at all. In this case, you should run a scan and**install the latest correct audio driver** .

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .

2. Connect your Jabra headset to the computer and it should be automatically detected by the program.
3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.

4. Select the language you prefer and click**Update** .
