 You can update the audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website and downloading the correct driver. Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills.
