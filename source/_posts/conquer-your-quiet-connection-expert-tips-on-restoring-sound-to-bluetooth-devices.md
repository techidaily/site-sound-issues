### Fix 4: Update your Bluetooth driver

 This problem may occur if you have the wrong or outdated (or even none) Bluetooth driver. So you should update your Bluetooth driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b46ffcde1143.jpg)

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b627e9c324d0.jpg)

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 4) Restart your computer, play some music and see if **Bluetooth Connected But No Sound**  problem has been resolved.

### Fix 5: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended.[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC. Wait a few minutes, and it will give you a detailed report of your PC status.
3. If Fortectdetects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fortectstartrepair.png)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with a full money-back guarantee and full technical support. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact their support team.

Once finished with the repair, check if the error has been resolved.
