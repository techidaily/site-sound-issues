 Solution 5: Update the audio driver

 If the installed audio driver is outdated, it may not support the Audacity record feature. To fix the error, you can try to update the audio driver.  
  
 You can update the audio driver manually. Just go to your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest audio driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
