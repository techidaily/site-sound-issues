## 1\. Set your microphone as the default device

 Oftentimes, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But you may have multiple input or recording devices connected. It would occur to you that your computer is using another device instead of the one you’re attempting to use. In order to set your Redragon microphone as your input device, follow the instructions below:

 1) At the bottom-right corner of your taskbar, right-click your speaker icon and select **Open Sound settings** .  
  
![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-sound-settings-1.png)

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) When the Sound window opens, select the **Recording**  tab. Click on your microphone and then click **Set Default > OK** .

## 2\. Turn on app permissions for your microphone

 1) Press the **Windows + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.

 2) Click **Privacy** .  
  
![Privacy in Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy.png)
