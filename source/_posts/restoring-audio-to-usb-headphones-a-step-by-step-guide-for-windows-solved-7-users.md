 **Step Three: Check Hardware**

 1) Try your headphone on your other devices, such as your cell phone. Make sure it works properly on another device. If not, you might need to see if this problem is caused by broken headphone.

 2) If you have external speakers, make sure that they are disconnected from your computer. Speakers and headphones are not supposed to work together unless you have made some changes to the system settings.

 3) If you are having problems hearing through your headphone only when playing some games, you might need to go to the Advanced settings of the game and see if you can find some settings related to the audio that can be modified.
