 The Bluetooth Support Service is running in normal terms and you should be able to pair your device and use it normally.

## Fix 5: Change the Bluetooth devices discovery setting

 As per quite some Reddit readers, setting the Bluetooth devices discovery setting to Advanced helps to fix the Bluetooth not working problem on their Windows 11 computers. To see if this does the trick for you as well:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key together. Select**Bluetooth & devices** , then**Devices.**  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bluetooth-settings.png)

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bluetooth-settings-advanced.png)

 Try to see if your Bluetooth starts working properly. If the problem remains, please move on.

## Fix 6: Repair your system files

 It’s possible that Bluetooth not working issue is caused by a Windows system error. Corrupt, damaged, or missing system files can cause Windows issues. To check if this is the exact cause, you can either use the Windows built-in tool to run a basic check or use an automatic tool to perform a complete diagnosis.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/windows-11-bluetooth-not-working/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fit for you.
* [Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

 If you prefer efficiency, **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a professional Windows repair tool that can scan your system and fix it in one click. It is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
