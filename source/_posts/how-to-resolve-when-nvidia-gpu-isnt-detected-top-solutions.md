## Windows N't Detect My Headphones? Here's the Solution

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/img_5a7ad939c00cb.png)

 After you connected your headphone to Windows 10 computer, you could not hear sound from the headphones. In Playback devices, the headphone didn’t even show up. What happened? Don’t worry. This is a common issue in Windows 10\. You can fix the error with one of the solutions below.

 **Before you try the solutions, ensure this is not a hardware issue** :

 If your computer has another port, _**plug your headphones to another por** t_ and see if the problem still persists. If you could hear the sound from headphones with another port, the problem probably is the port. If you don’t have another port available to plug into headphones, skip this troubleshooting.

 If possible,**_connect your headphones to another computer_** to check to see if the problem persists. If you can use the headphones properly on another computer, the problem is the computer settings. Then try following solutions. If you can’t hear the sound using the headphone on another computer either, the problem is probably the headphones.

 There are **five**  solutions to fix the problem on your computer. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down at the top of the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Show and enable the headphones manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your sound card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install the driver correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
