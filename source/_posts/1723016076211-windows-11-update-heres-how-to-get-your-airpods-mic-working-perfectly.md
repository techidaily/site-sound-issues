#### Option 1 – Install the latest Bluetooth driver manually

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.  
 Then, type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

3. Restart your PC and check the AirPods microphone after the whole process is finished.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, the next one might suit you.

### Fix 4: Use a Bluetooth adapter

 In some cases, the built-in Bluetooth adapter cannot handle AirPods, so your AirPods microphone can’t work properly. The solution is to use a new Bluetooth adapter.

 If your AirPods are working well on iPhone and there’s nothing you can do to your PC, give the new Bluetooth adapter a go.

 Here I suggest you to borrow from your family member or friend, if it’s working, then you can consider buying a new Bluetooth adapter.

 AirPods are great, hope this post would help you fix the AirPods mic not working issue. But if nothing works for you, maybe turn to other hands-free headsets would be a good idea.
