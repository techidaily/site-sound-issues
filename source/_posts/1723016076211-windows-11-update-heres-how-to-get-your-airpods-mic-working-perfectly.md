### Fix 2: Update your Bluetooth Drivers

 Normally, if your AirPods microphone isn’t working properly, it’s probably using a broken or outdated Bluetooth driver. Then, updating your Bluetooth driver would fix this problem.

There’re 2 ways to update drivers, manually and automatically.

#### Option 1 – Install the latest Bluetooth driver manually

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.  
 Then, type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

### Fix 3: Install Windows updates

 Microsoft releases Windows 10 updates to fix certain issues and offer new features. Many times, users find their problems were solved after running Microsoft Windows updates, and there’re users have reported the mic started working after updating Windows 10 to the latest build.

So follow the steps below to install the latest Windows updates.

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time on your keyboard to open Windows Settings. Then, click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. In the Windows Update panel, click **Check for updates** . Windows will check and download the latest available patches automatically.

 If you see “You’re up to date” after clicking the button, your PC confirms that it has all Windows updates.

### Fix 4: Use a Bluetooth adapter

 In some cases, the built-in Bluetooth adapter cannot handle AirPods, so your AirPods microphone can’t work properly. The solution is to use a new Bluetooth adapter.

 If your AirPods are working well on iPhone and there’s nothing you can do to your PC, give the new Bluetooth adapter a go.

 Here I suggest you to borrow from your family member or friend, if it’s working, then you can consider buying a new Bluetooth adapter.

 AirPods are great, hope this post would help you fix the AirPods mic not working issue. But if nothing works for you, maybe turn to other hands-free headsets would be a good idea.
