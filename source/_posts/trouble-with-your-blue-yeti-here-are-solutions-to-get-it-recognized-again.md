### Fix 1\. Try another USB port/cable

 First, to rule out a hardware issue, you can try another USB port and make sure your USB cable is properly connected. Check whether your microphone goes back to work. Many users find it works when they switch the USB port from 3.0 to 2.0.

 If Blue Yeti is still not showing up on your PC, you can try another USB cable. You can easily get a[**replacement cable**](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Snowball-Product-Picture-Compatibility/dp/B08JG1SNB7?tag=drivereasycom-20) at Amazon. Check that the status light is illuminated.

#### Option 1 –**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you’re not confident playing with device drivers, you can update the driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
