## 1\. Make sure the microphone is not muted

 For basic troubleshooting, you can first check if your SteelSeries Actics 1 is muted. On the left earcup, make sure this button is not pushed towards the mute end.

 The mute button on the left earcup

 If the microphone is still not working even if you’re sure it’s not muted, you can try the following workarounds to fix it.

## 2\. Allow access to the microphone

 Unlike SteelSeries Arctis 7, 9, and 9X, there’s no factory reset button on Arctis 1\. So if the issue is not on your headphone’s end, please check if you have allowed access to your microphone. Here’s how:

### in Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key to invoke the Search box and type**microphone** .
2. Select**Microphone Privacy Settings** from the results list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/microphone-setup.jpg)
3. Under the**Allow Apps To Access Your Microphone** tab, ensure that the toggle is in the**On** position so that other apps can use your microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/on.jpg)
4. Scroll down to choose which app can access your microphone, and make sure that you have it set for all the apps you want.  
![choose apps to allow](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/allow-apps-microphone.jpg)
5. Now check if your mic is working for the app you’re using.

## 3\. Change your microphone settings

 Normally, Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set iy as the default input device once your headphone is plugged into it. But sometimes you’ll need to set it as the default device manually:

![set as default microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default.png)
3. Also, make sure it displays your headphone name correctly and shows strong signals, which means your computer successfully recognizes your device. If your headphone is shown as something else such as Wireless Controller (below), there’s something wrong with your mic settings, so you should re-connect your headset.

## 4\. Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your SteelSeries Arctis 1 headset won’t work if you’re using incorrect or outdated audio or headset drivers. So you should update both the Realtek audio driver and your headphone driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process requires visiting the manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers and install them manually, which is time-consuming, technical, and risky. We don’t recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:
