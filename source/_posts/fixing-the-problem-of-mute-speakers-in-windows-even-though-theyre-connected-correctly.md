### Fix 1\. Make sure your Tozo T6 is working

 The first thing is to make sure your headphone is well-charged and working fine. You can pair your earbuds with your phone to check if it’s working.

### Fix 2\. Turn off other devices

 Your PC might be connecting to other devices, and this might cause your Tozo T6 to not work. So you can disconnect other Bluetooth devices to avoid interferences.

### Fix 3\. Update Windows 11

 The Tozo T6 not working on Windows 11 is a very common problem, and it might have been fixed in a newer version.

Try running Windows Updates and check if your Tozo T6 is working again.

### Fix 4\. Re-add the headphone

 If your Tozo T6 is connected but there’s no sound at all, you should remove your device, and add it again, which is a simple troubleshooting step to rule out the temporary glitch.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** +**R** key to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type in**ms-settings:connecteddevices** , and then press**Enter** .

If your Tozo T6 still has no sound, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 5\. Update audio drivers

 If your PC fails to work with certain Bluetooth earbuds such as Tozo T6, you can try updating the onboard sound card drivers and Bluetooth drivers, which are essentially important to make sure your headphone work with your PC.

There are two ways for you to update an audio driver:

**Option 1 – Manually –**  The manual process requires you to visit the manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver and install them manually, which is time-consuming, technical, and risky. We don’t recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

**Option 2 – Automatically –** Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to your sound device or your sound card driver to download the latest and correct driver, and then you can manually install it.

### Fix 6\. Re-enable the Bluetooth driver

 Many users find their Bluetooth earphones stop working when they upgrade the system to Windows 11.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** +**R** key to open the Run box.

 2) Type in**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

 3) While in the Device Manager, expand the**Bluetooth** list.

 4) Right-click**TOZO-T6 Avrcp Transport** and**TOZO-T6** , select**Disable device** .

6) Now enable**TOZO-T6** only.
