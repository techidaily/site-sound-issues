 If you’re using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date, the Logitech G533 headset microphone won’t function properly. So you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes the problem. Here are two options you can get the latest and right audio driver in a safe way: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually download and install the driver

 Logitech keeps updating drivers for its devices. All you need is go to the **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024844153--Downloads-G533-Wireless-Gaming-Headset)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your audio driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged _Logitech G533 driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
