### Fix 2 – Allow access to your microphone

 To make your microphone work normally, it’s also necessary to allow the operating system, browser and apps to use your microphone. Make sure to turn on the permission especially if you’ve just connected a new mic to your computer. Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu. Select**Privacy** .

### Fix 3 – Check your PC sound settings

 If you have several peripherals connected to the computer, there’s a good chance that your preferred device is not set as default and thus the microphone doesn’t work properly in Google Meet. To see if that’s the case, check the sound settings as follows.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**mmsys.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sound-settings-1.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Recording** tab. First make sure your microphone is enabled (showing a green checkmark). If it’s not and displays a grey down-arrow icon, right-click it and click**Enable** .

 Test your microphone again to see if it works without problem. If the issue persists, check out the next solution below.

### Fix 4 – Check Google Meet’s settings

 Normally, your browser and Google Meet will use the microphone you set as default on your computer, but in case something messed up, you can manually check if Google Meet is identifying and accessing the correct audio device.

1. Enter your online meeting on Google Meet. Click the**lock icon** at the far right of the Google chrome search bar, and**toggle on the permission to your microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting.jpg)
2. Make sure your microphone is not turned off.
3. Click the**vertical ellipsis icon** at the top left and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting-2.jpg)
4. From the drop-down menu under Microphone, select your primary microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting-3.jpg)

 If you still can’t use the microphone in Google Meet, the last resort is to**double-check the physical connection** .

 For example, if you’re using a wired headset, make sure it’s securely plugged in and check if your USB ports are functioning well. If you use a Bluetooth headset, try repairing it to your computer and see how things go.
