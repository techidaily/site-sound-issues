### Fix 1 – Restart Cyberpunk 2077

 It seems a cliche but a simple restart can usually fix various game glitches. Restart your PC and relaunch Cyberpunk 2077 to test. If this doesn’t help, move on to the second trick.

### Fix 2 – Change USB port

 Cyberpunk 2077 audio not working properly might be caused by a faulty headphone port. To rule out this possibility, simply**replug your audio equipment to another USB port** which should be located at both the front and back of your PC, and play the game again. If sound crackling persists, take a look at the solutions below.

### Fix 3 – Adjust the sound settings

 Improper sound settings on your PC will also lead to audio crackling throughout the Cyberpunk 2077 game. Make some tweaks as follow and see if that solves your issue.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then, type**control** and click**OK** .

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 The audio issues of Cyberpunk 2077 may indicate your audio driver is wrong, faulty or outdated. To improve the audio quality and enjoy the stunning sound effect of Cyberpunk 2077, you should install the latest audio driver.

There are two ways for you to do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the sound card manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
