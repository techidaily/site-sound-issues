### Fix 1: Check the connection of your audio device

 Let’s start with some easy troubleshooting. If your in-game audio isn’t working, first you want to**make sure the physical connection is robust** . Be sure the cable is not broken, and is securely plugged into the correct headphone jack. You can also try a replug and see if it gets your audio back. And if you’re using a headset with a volume switch, make sure it’s set to a moderate value.

If the connection is fine, you can take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Make sure your audio device is set up properly

 Next you need to**check if your audio device is properly configured on Windows** . (If your device works everywhere except in Cyberpunk 2077, you can jump to the next fix.)

Here’s how:

1. On the bottom right corner of your screen, right-click the**Sound** icon and select**Open Sound settings** .

3. Now you can launch Cyberpunk 2077 and test the audio.

If the problem remains, you can move on to the next method.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 Though Cyberpunk 2077 is filled with bugs, the sound not working issue could result from**a faulty or outdated audio driver** . If you didn’t update any drivers before installing Cyberpunk 2077, definitely do it now as it could save your day.

 To update the audio driver manually, you can go to your audio card manufacturer’s website, then download and install the correct driver step-by-step. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 If updating drivers doesn’t help you, simply take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

 New games tend to be buggy, so there’ll be multiple patches after the release.[According to some gamers](https://forums.cdprojektred.com/index.php?threads/sound-issues.11040671/post-12308855) , the Cyberpunk 2077 no sound issue could be fixed by scanning and repairing game files.

Here’re the guides on how to do that on different platforms:

 You might need to verify the game a couple of times to repair all the files.

Now launch Cyberpunk 2077 and see if you can hear anything.
