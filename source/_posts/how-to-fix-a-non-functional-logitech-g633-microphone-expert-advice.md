## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.
* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.
