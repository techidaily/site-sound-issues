Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
