1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.

3. Check the volume knob on the right ear and **make sure the mic is not muted or the volumes are not too low** .

 Your HyperX headphone should now be enabled now. Test if the mic is working. If so, congratulations! But if not, don’t worry, since we have a few more fixes.

## 4\. Update your audio drivers

## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.
