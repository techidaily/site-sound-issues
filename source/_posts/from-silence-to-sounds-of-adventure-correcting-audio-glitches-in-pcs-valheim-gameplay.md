Driver updates bring new features and would fix known bugs which lead to the malfunctions of your devices. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now as it may fix your issue immediately.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your sound driver

 This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. If you know the specifications of your PC, you can try to update your audio driver manually.

 You can do this by visiting the website of your motherboard manufacturer, then search for your exact model. When you find your motherboard, go to its support page and download the driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system.

## 4\. Verify integrity of game files

 If any of your game files are missing or corrupted, you would most likely encounter any sorts of issues including no sound during gameplay. In this case, you need to verify the integrity of game files, which can ensure that the installation of your game is up-to-date and if necessary repair any bad or corrupted game data.

Here’s how to do this:

 1) Open your Steam Client. Under the **LIBRARY**  tab, find your game title and right-click it. Then select **Properties** .

![Valheim properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/verify-intergrity-of-game-files-properties.png)

 2) Select **LOCAL FILES**  and then click on the **Verify integrity of game files…**  tab. This will take some minutes to redownload and replace any missing or corrupted game files.
