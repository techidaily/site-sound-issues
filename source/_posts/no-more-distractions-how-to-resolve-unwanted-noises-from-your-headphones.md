## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Corsair headset will be set as default automatically once it’s connected properly. But if you’ve constantly changed between the headsets and speakers, the settings might be messed up. And you’ll need to configure the correct setup manually.

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-0.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by and click**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-1.jpg)
3. On the**Playback** tab, make sure your Corsair headset is enabled (covered with a green check mark). Then, click it and click**Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sound-settings-3.jpg)
4. Navigate to the**Recording** tab. Select the Corsair headset microphone and click**Set Default** .
