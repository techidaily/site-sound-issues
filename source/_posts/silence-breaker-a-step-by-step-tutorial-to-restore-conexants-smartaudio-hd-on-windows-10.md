Usually, you can download drivers from device manufacturer or PC manufacturer. Conexant does not produce drivers themselves. If you are using a brand computer, go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the driver. If not, you can go to the motherboard manufacturer’s website to download the driver. Drivers can always be downloaded in Support or Download section of the website.
