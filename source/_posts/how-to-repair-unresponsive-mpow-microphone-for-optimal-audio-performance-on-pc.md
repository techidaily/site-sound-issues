## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/connection-1.jpg)
* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.
* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-25.png)
2. Make sure**Microphone access** and**Logitech G Pro X** are both set to**On** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-26.png)

**On Windows 10:**

1. In the search box, type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1-4.jpg)
2. Click the**Change** button and**turn on** the Microphone access for this device.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2-6.jpg)
3. **Toggle on** the button under Allow apps to access your microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3-6.jpg)
4. Scroll down to make sure the desktop app’s access to your microphone is set to**On** .

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 The sound settings may sometimes be messed up after a system update and thus you need to configure the proper setup manually.

1. In the search box, type**control** **panel** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/microsoft-team-control-panel.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** from the drop-down menu next to View by, and click**Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2-4.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**Recording** tab, and make sure your Logitech G Pro X headset microphone is**enabled** (there should be a green checkmark). Then, click the microphone and click**Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-5.jpg)
4. Right-click the microphone and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-6.jpg)
5. Go to the**Levels** tab. Then,**drag the volume slider to the max** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-11.jpg)

 Now that your Logitech Pro X microphone is set as default and the volume is turned up, test the issue again. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your headset from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
