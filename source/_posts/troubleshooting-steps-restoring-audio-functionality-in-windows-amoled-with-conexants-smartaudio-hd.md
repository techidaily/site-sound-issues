 Audio enhancement is designed to make your system sound perfect. But things can go wrong somethings. To fix your sound stuttering problem, please perform:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** \+ **R** on the keyboard at the same time.
2. Type **mmsys.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mmsyssound.jpg)

5. Test to see if your sound is still stuttering. If yes, go back to step 4 and try some other formats until you find the one that works for you.

 If your audio problem remains, don’t worry, you need to update your audio drivers. Move on to method 4 for help.
