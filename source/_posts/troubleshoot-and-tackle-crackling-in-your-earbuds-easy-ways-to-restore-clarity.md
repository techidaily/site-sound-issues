5. Ensure that the game voice balance on the right ear cup of the headset is somewhere in the middle.

 When the connections are fine, but the Astro A50 no sound issue persists, you can try the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Set your Astro A50 as the default

 Next, you need to**check if your headset is properly configured on Windows** .

#### 1\. Check Volume mixer settings

1. Right-click the **volume icon** at the bottom right corner, and click **Open Volume mixer** .

2. Make sure all the entries set at an appropriate level. In my case, I set headphones and my applications to 100.  
![volume appropriate](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/volume-mixer.jpg)
3. Now test and see if there is any sound from your Astro A50.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.

4. Test the audio.

If the problem remains, you can move on to the next method.

## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

### Option 2: Update your sound card driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your sound card, and your variant of Windows, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
