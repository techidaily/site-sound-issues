### **Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues**

If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to troubleshoot hardware issues. You can follow the steps below to troubleshoot hardware issues:

1. Try connecting your Logitech G230 to **another port**  on your computer. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to the next step, below.
2. Try connecting your Logitech G230 to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your PC for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC, you should contact Logitech for support.
Hopefully one of the fixes above resolved this issue for you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please leave your comment below.
