## Fix 4: Update sound card driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver in your computer can cause your voice chat not working in PUBG, so you should make sure that your sound card driver is up to date.  There are two ways to update your sound card driver:**manually** and**automatically** . **Manually update the driver** : you can go to your sound card manufacturerâ€™s website, search for the latest version of your sound card driver, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills. **Automatically update the driver** : if you donâ€™t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):  1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.  2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b5fd5faedb2b.jpg)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged sound card (and microphone if any) to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), then install it in your computer.  Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b5fd61613c73.jpg)
