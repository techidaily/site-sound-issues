### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 You can start troubleshooting the Steam voice chat not working issue by ruling out the hardware issues.

Here is how to do it:

 1) **Make sure you have plugged your mic into the right connector on your computer** . Typically, analog mic connections are pink and should be plugged into the pink connector on your headset. But if there is no pink connector on your headset, you might have to consult the manual for your headset to make sure your mic is properly plugged.

 2)**Connect your sound device to a different port** . Sometimes the mic mot working problem may occur if the port you’re using is faulty. If you get the microphone working on Steam again after switching to another port, then congrats! (and avoid using the faulty port). If the**mic not working** **on Steam** issue remains, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.
