## Fix 1: Troubleshoot the connection

 The first thing you need to try is to make sure the headset’s volume wheel is set to a reasonable value.

 Then, you need to check if the Base Station and your headset are synced together.

1. Ensure the Mode Switch on the Base Station is set to the right device (PC or PS4).
2. Place A50 headset on the Base Station, and make sure it’s seated correctly.
3. Once synced together, you will see the LED lights on the front of the Base Station will starting Blinking.
4. Make sure the optical cable is fully plugged into the “**MICRO USB** ” and the other end of the cable is plugged firmly into the USB port of your PC.

5. Ensure that the game voice balance on the right ear cup of the headset is somewhere in the middle.

 When the connections are fine, but the Astro A50 no sound issue persists, you can try the next fix below.
