 Be sure to choose the driver**that’s compatible with your exact sound card model** and**your version of Windows** .

**Or**

### **Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues**

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to troubleshoot hardware issues. You can follow the steps below to troubleshoot hardware issues:

1. Try connecting your Logitech G633 to **another port**  on your computer. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to the next step, below.
