## Fix 1 – Allow access to your microphone on your PC

 If your Corsair HS35 is not activated in the Window settings, your PC will lack the access to your microphone and so the mic just won’t start to work at all. Follow these steps to allow access to your microphone:

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings, then select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/setting-Privacy.jpg)
2. Select**Microphone** on the left panel, then click the**Change** button to see if the toggle is**On** in the pop-up menu. If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mic-setting-1.jpg)
3. Check to see if the toggle in the**Allow apps to access your microphone** section is turned**On** . If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.

## Fix 3 – Update your audio driver

 The mic not working problem may also occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. Therefore you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 You can manually install the most recent driver from your PC manufacturer’s official website or from the **[Corsair download page](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads)**  . But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can do it for you.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DE-5.7.2-SCAN.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Fix 5 – Use a USB audio card

 If your computer’s sound card is defective or if your laptop/desktop system has a faulty 3.5mm audio port, the Corsair HS35 mic may not be able to work properly. If that is the case, you might think about using a USB Audio Card, which is an external sound device that can **bypass problems in your built-in sound card and regain the audio function for you** .
