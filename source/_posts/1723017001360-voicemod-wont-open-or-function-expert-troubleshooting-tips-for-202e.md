### Fix 3: Check settings of the target program

 For your Voicemod to work properly, you should also make sure the target program is configured properly. Software like Discord has its own voice settings, which you should check after installing Voicemod.

Here’s an example of Discord:

1. Open Discord and open**Settings** .
2. In the left pane, select**Voice & Video** . Under**INPUT DEVICE** , click and select**Microphone (Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDM))** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/discord-voicemod-settings.jpg)
3. Now you can check if Voicemod is working correctly.

If this doesn’t work for you, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Reinstall Voicemod drivers

 In some cases, the problem indicates you’re using**faulty or outdated drivers** . To fix that, you can simply reinstall the Voicemod driver.

First you need to uninstall the Voicemod driver:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** to open Device Manager.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-run-box-ok.jpg)
2. Click to expand**Audio inputs and outputs** . Right-click**Microphone (Voicemod Virtual Audio Device (WDM))** and select**Uninstall device** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/voicemod-reinstall-2.jpg)
4. Restart your PC.

 Next you’ll need to install the Voicemod driver. You can do that manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Install the Voicemod driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to install the driver manually. To do so, simply visit the[Voicemod official website](https://www.voicemod.net/install-voicemod-driver/) , then follow the instructions to install.

#### Option 2: Install the Voicemod driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to install the Voicemod driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-voicemod-update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Fix 5: Make sure Windows is up to date

 Windows 10 includes 2 types of updates, which respectively offer security patches and a performance boost. Sometimes Windows updates fix some software or driver conflicts automatically. Given this, your voice chat issue could be easily solved by**updating your system** .

Here’s a quick guide for that:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then search and install the system updates automatically.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed **all**  the system updates, repeat these steps until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once complete, restart your PC and check if Voicemod is working correctly.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, simply try the next one below.

### Fix 6: Overwrite current version with fresh install

 Some users reported that reinstalling could fix the Voicemod issue. You can try the same and see if this works. Note that this time we’re taking a different approach—instead of uninstalling, we just**overwrite the current version with the latest** .

 To do so, simply go to the[**Voicemode website**](https://www.voicemod.net/) and download the latest installer. Next open it and follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. This will automatically overwrite the previous build.
