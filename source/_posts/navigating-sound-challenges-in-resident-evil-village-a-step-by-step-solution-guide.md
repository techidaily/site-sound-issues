1. [**Allow access to microphone (for Windows 10 users)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/logitech-g430-mic-not-working-fixed/#Fix1)

### **Fix 1: Allow access to microphone (for Windows 10 users)**

 If your Logitech G430 microphone stops working in Windows 10, the first thing you should check is to turn on the microphone access. Here’s what you need to do:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**  and**I** at the same time.

 (If this issue happens in the voice chat when you play games, you can also check if the microphone status for that game is**ON** .)

 Re-plug your microphone again to see if it works.

### **Fix 2: Update your audio driver**

 A missing or outdated audio driver in your computer can cause your Logitech G430 mic not working, so you should verify and keep your audio driver up to date.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update your driver** : you can go to your sound card manufacturer’s website, search for the latest version of your sound card driver, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update the driver** : if you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged sound card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), then install it in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_** ).
