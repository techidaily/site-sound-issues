### Before getting started

 Whenever the sound is not working in Borderlands 3, you can try to save quitting or going to the menu. Restarting the game entirely can always fix the issue.  
  
 If there are just no weapon sounds, just**switch weapons** and it may go back to normal. Your sound issue might be temporary.  
  
 However, if it keeps giving you the silent treatment, you can try the fixes below.

### Fix 1: Check your default output device

 First, you need to make sure that the default playback device (your headset or speaker) is correctly set, especially when you have multiple audio outputs.

1. Right-click the volume icon on the right corner of your taskbar.
2. Click Sounds.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/sound-settings-1.jpg)
3. In the Playback tab, select your device and click Set Default. Then click Apply to save the changes. (If already default, you can set another device as default and set it back again.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/default-device-1.jpg)
4. Go to**Audio Settings** of Borderlands 3 and make sure the output audio is set to your default device.

5. Launch your Borderlands 3.
6. Go to**Settings > System > Sound** , then click**App volume and device preferences** under**Advanced sound options** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/advanded-sounds-1.jpg)
7. You’ll see all apps currently using audio and their sound levels. Make sure there’s no**x** symbol for**Borderlands 3** and move the volume slider of Borderlands 3 up and down to ensure it’s working properly.
8. Restart your Borderlands 3 to test the sound.

**For PS4 users** :  
  
 Go to**Sound and Screen** \>**Audio Out Settings** and make sure the default output device is correctly set.  
  
 Some players find switching from linear PCM to Bitstream (Dolby) resolved the sound issue.

If the sound issue still persists, then head on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Turn off Spatial sound

 Many Borderlands players find Spatial sound is always the culprit of their Borderlands 3 no sound issue. To fix it, you need to turn off Spatial sound both in your Windows settings and in-game settings.

1. Select your default audio device and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/audio-device-properties-1.jpg)
2. Choose the**Spatial sound** tab. Then select**Windows Sonic for Headphones** and click**Apply** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/spatial-sounds-turn-off-1.png)
4. In Borderlands 3, go to**Sound** settings and set**Spatial Sound** to**Disabled** .
5. Restart your game and see if this fixes your sound not working issue.

 On the contrary, some of the Borderlands players find it fixed their sound problems by**turning on the Spatial sounds** both in Windows and in-game settings.  
  
 If unfortunately, turning off Spatial sounds didn’t help, you can try turning it on instead.

4. If this fix doesn’t work for you, then uncheck both**Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** and**Give exclusive mode applications priority** .
5. Run your Borderlands 3 again to check your sound issues.

### Fix 4: Update the audio driver

 Are the audio drivers up-to-date for the sound hardware? Sometimes the drivers are at fault. To fix it, you can update or reinstall the audio driver.

 **Note: Outdated or corrupt drivers can cause weird computer issues. To improve your computer performance and game experience, it’s recommended to always keep all of your drivers up to date.**

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1: Manually

 To update your audio driver manually, you may always let Windows find the latest driver for you. However, sometimes Windows think the drivers are already the “latest”, and you’ll need to find the latest and correct driver on the manufacturer’s website and install it into your computer manually.

**Note:** Ensure to download the latest correct driver that is compatible with your computer operating system.  
  
 Before installing the new driver, you’d better right-click the old driver and select**Uninstall device** and tick the box**Delete the driver software for this device** .

#### Option 2: Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** **come straight from** **the manufacturer** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now-4.png)
3. Click the**Update** button next to your sound card driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You will get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/update-all-your-drivers-1.jpg)
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Launch your Borderlands 3 again to test the sound issue.
