### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 Faulty or outdated device drivers can lead to various gaming issues. If you don’t remember the last time you update your drivers, definitely do it now, as this could keep your audio devices in tip-top condition and very well tackle the Sea of Theives voice chat not working issue.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

 After you’ve made those tweaks, launch SoT again to test whether you can talk to your crews. If not, try the last fix.

### Fix 8 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 According to some players, Sea of Thieves voice chat won’t work when their antivirus is enabled. The anti-virus software aims to protect your PC from potential threats but sometimes it can block certain features of other apps or games. To see if that’s the cause, turn off the antivirus and relaunch your game. If the problem gets fixed,**add SoT into the exception list** so that you can use both without conflicts.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
