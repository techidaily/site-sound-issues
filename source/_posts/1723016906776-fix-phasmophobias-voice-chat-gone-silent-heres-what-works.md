### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default playback device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

Here is how to do it:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .
