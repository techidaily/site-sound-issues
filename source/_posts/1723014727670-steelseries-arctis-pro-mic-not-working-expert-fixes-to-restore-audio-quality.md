## 1\. Make sure the microphone is not muted

 For basic troubleshooting, you can first check if your SteelSeries Actics 1 is muted. On the left earcup, make sure this button is not pushed towards the mute end.

 If the microphone is still not working even if you’re sure it’s not muted, you can try the following workarounds to fix it.

## 2\. Allow access to the microphone

 Unlike SteelSeries Arctis 7, 9, and 9X, there’s no factory reset button on Arctis 1\. So if the issue is not on your headphone’s end, please check if you have allowed access to your microphone. Here’s how:

### in Windows 10

 Did this fix your SteelSeries Arctis 1 mic not working? If not, move on to the next method.

## 3\. Change your microphone settings

 Normally, Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set iy as the default input device once your headphone is plugged into it. But sometimes you’ll need to set it as the default device manually:

### in Windows 10

1. Right-click on the sound icon in the lower-right corner of your desktop, and select**Sounds** .

![set as default microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default.png)
3. Also, make sure it displays your headphone name correctly and shows strong signals, which means your computer successfully recognizes your device. If your headphone is shown as something else such as Wireless Controller (below), there’s something wrong with your mic settings, so you should re-connect your headset.

## 4\. Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your SteelSeries Arctis 1 headset won’t work if you’re using incorrect or outdated audio or headset drivers. So you should update both the Realtek audio driver and your headphone driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process requires visiting the manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers and install them manually, which is time-consuming, technical, and risky. We don’t recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)
