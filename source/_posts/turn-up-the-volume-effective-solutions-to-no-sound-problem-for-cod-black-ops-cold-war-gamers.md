## 1\. Try G435 on a different device

 When your G435 has no sound all of a sudden, the first thing to do is to see if the problem is with the headset itself, or with your computer settings. And the easiest way to do so is to use the headset on a different device.

 For instance, when you notice that your G435 doesn’t make any sound when on your computer, try to disconnect it from your current device, and try it on your phone, or another computer via Bluetooth or Lightspeed connection, and see if G435 works fine on a second device.

 If the same problem is seen on the second device, the problem could be with the headset itself. In that case, it’s always suggested to try it on a third device. If the Logitech G435 gaming headset doesn’t work either on 3 consecutive devices (computers, tablets, and/or mobile phones), it’s very likely that your headset is at fault. If so, you should talk to Logitech support to see if they can provide further support.

 If your Logitech G435 works fine on the other devices but your computer, please move on to the fixes below.

## 9\. Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues with your Logitech G435 gaming headset and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones.
