 Hopefully this works for you. But if not, there are two more fixes for you to try…

### Method 2: Update your device drivers

 Your front audio jack may not be working if you’re using a wrong driver or it’s out of date. You should update your device drivers to see if that’s the case for you. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** .

**2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b344dbcb3a78.jpg)

**3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to_each of your devices_ to download the latest and correct driver for it, then you can manually install it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b3494ff64802.jpg)

 You can do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

### Method 3: Try the back audio jacks

 You may have hardware issues with your front audio jacks. So it’s worth checking the audio jacks on your motherboard to see if your issues are occurring on your front jack only.

 Try connecting your audio device to the audio jacks on the back of your computer. If your audio device works properly, then the problem is on your front audio jack. You may need to contact your computer manufacturer for advice or bring your computer to an authorized service provider to have it serviced.
