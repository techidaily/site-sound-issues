## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Whenever you’re troubleshooting a headset with no sound, first verify it’s not a hardware issue. Here is how to do a quick check:

* First,**plug your Logitech G933 headset into another audio jack** to inspect the port.
* **Connect your headset to another machine** to test if the device is intact. If it doesn’t play any sound neither, chances are that your headset is damaged, and you’d better contact Logitech for repair or replacement.

 If your hardware works fine, the problem may be related to the sound settings, the audio driver or even the Logitech software you’ve installed. Keep reading for more corresponding solutions.
