### Fix 1: Try some easy troubleshooting tips

 Before we dive into other fixes, try some easy troubleshooting tips first.

1. **Check which Bluetooth version** your Bluetooth audio device supports. If it only supports **Bluetooth 2.0** , you may probably suffer from the audio lag issue, because the small bandwidth will lag the audio stream of high bit rate. If so, you may need to replace it with a new one that supports **Bluetooth 4.0** .
2. **Check the battery of your Bluetooth audio device** . Make sure its battery is sufficient enough for the connection.
3. Place your Bluetooth audio device **close to** your PC to ensure a stable connection.
4. Turn off any other nearby Bluetooth devices to **reduce the interference** .

See if Bluetooth audio lags or not. If not, try the next fix, below.
