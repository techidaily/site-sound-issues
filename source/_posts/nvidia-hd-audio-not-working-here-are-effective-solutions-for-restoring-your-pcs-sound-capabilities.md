## Understanding the problem

 Before jumping into solutions, let’s first understand why your microphone may stop working in CS2\. Here are some of the common reasons:

* **Faulty hardware:** Damaged cables, loose connections, and mic malfunctions can prevent proper audio input.
* **Microphone permissions** : Your system may block apps from accessing your mic. You may need to grant CS2 access.
* **Incorrect mic settings:** The mic you want to use may not be set as the default input device in your operating system or in the CS2 voice settings. Your mic’s input volume could also be muted or set too low.
* **Outdated audio drivers** : If your audio drivers are outdated or incompatible, they can cause mic issues. Keeping them updated is essential.
* **Conflicts with other apps** : Too many apps running in the background can interfere with your mic input in CS2.

 The screenshots shown below come from Windows 11\. If you’re running Windows 10, your screen might look slightly different. But the steps you take will remain consistent.

### 1\. Check if it’s a hardware issue

 To isolate the problem, you should check if your microphone or headset is broken.

* Test your mic on another PC.  

 If it works, it indicates an issue with your current PC.  

 If it doesn’t work on another PC, chances are it’s malfunctioning. Reach out to customer support for repair if it’s under warranty. Or you may need to purchase a new one.

* Check mic cable connections to the PC to ensure no loose plugs.

 If you’re sure that your microphone is functioning well but your teammates still cannot hear you, you’ll need to tweak some settings.

### 2\. Make sure your mic is set as the default input device

 Sometimes, your microphone may not be set as the default input device, both on your operating system’s sound settings and in-game settings.

Follow the steps below to check it.

#### Windows sound settings

1. Press the**Windows logo key** , then type**Sound settings** . Click it from the list of results.

 If you confirm that both Steam and your game have access to your microphone but your issue still occurs, try the next fix below.

### 4\. Close unused background processes

 Too many programs accessing the mic can step on each other’s toes. To reduce conflicts, try to shut down background apps that can access the mic like Discord, Skype, VR clients, etc. Fewer apps accessing the mic reduces interference.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit Ener to open the Task Manager.  

![how to open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-taskmgr.jpg)
3. Right-click the process that you don’t need to run while playing CS2 and select**End task** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Discord-End-task.jpg)

 Close the window after you’re done and relaunch CS2 to check if your problem is solved.

### 5\. Download and install Windows updates

 Windows updates often come with bug fixes and optimizations specifically for audio components like microphones and sound cards. To resolve voice chat problems, keep your Windows fully updated.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** , then type**check for updates** . Open the settings**Check for updates** from the list of results.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Start-menu-Check-for-udpates.jpg)
2. When the updates are available, simply click on the button**Download & install** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Download-install-Windows-Update.jpg)  

 Or click on the**Check for updates** button and follow the on-screen instructions to download the latest updates for your system. You’ll be asked to restart your PC.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Check-for-updates-button.jpg)

 After the reboot, test your microphone and see if your teammates can hear you. If your problem persists, go to the next fix.

### 6\. Update audio drivers

 Keeping your audio drivers up-to-date is one effective way to fix microphone problems in CS2\. Updating your drivers provides important bug fixes, optimizations, and improvements specifically tailored to your microphone or sound card model by the manufacturer. This can greatly improve the stability and performance of your hardware.

 To update your audio driver, check the manufacturer of your sound device and visit their website for driver updates.

### 7\. Restore the system from restore point

 If you have ever created a restore point, try to restore your computer to a point before this problem arose.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** , then type**create a restore point** . Click**Create a restore point** from the list of results.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-create-a-restore-point.jpg)

![restore the system from restore point](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-System-Restore.jpg)
3. Click**Next** .  

![restore the system from restore point](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Restore-system-files-and-settings.jpg)
4. Select the restore point that you want to use from the list of results, then click**Scan for affected programs** .  

![restore the system from restore point](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Scan-for-affected-programs.jpg)
5. You will see a list of items that will be deleted if you restore to this restore point. If you’re OK with the deletions, select**Close** to proceed.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Confirm-Programs-and-drivers-that-will-be-deleted.jpg)  

 If this is not what you’re going to restore, go back to the previous step to select another restore point.
6. Click**Next** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Restore-your-computer-to-the-state-it-was-in-before-the-selected-event.jpg)
7. Confirm your restore point and click**Finish** . Then click**Yes** to start restoring the system from the restore point.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Confirm-your-restore-point.jpg)  

 Wait for the process to complete and your computer will be restarted.

### 8\. Verify integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of CS2’s game files can help fix microphone issues by detecting and repairing any corrupted, incomplete, or missing files that may be causing voice chat bugs. The verification checks that all necessary audio-related files are intact since problems with those could disrupt microphone input.

To do this, all you have to do is:

1. Open Steam. Under**LIBRARY** , right-click your game and select **Properties**  from the drop-down menu.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Counter-Strike-2-properties.jpg)
2. Select the **Installed Files**  tab and click on the **Verify integrity of game files**  button.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Counter-Strike-2-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
3. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 When the verification process is finished, get into your gameplay and check if your in-game mic is working properly.

### 9\. Repair system files

 If all else fails, it’s time to dig something deeper. You should check if you have any corrupted system files that may be disrupting proper audio input. System file errors could prevent microphone data from being processed correctly.

To fix it, run the System File Checker scan:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** , and type**command prompt** . Find Command Prompt from the list, then click**Run as administrator** .  

![how to open the Command Prompt as an admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-command-prompt-open-as-administrator.jpg)
2. Click**Yes** when you receive the UAC prompt.

3. Type**sfc /scannow** and hit Enter.  

![Windows 11 - System File Checker](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-sfc-scannow.jpg)
4. If damaged files are found, run **DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth**  to repair them.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-DISM-Online-Cleanup-Image-RestoreHealth.jpg)

 This built-in tool can detect and replace corrupt operating system files. However, it is limited in scope and may miss some problems. In this situation, you might need a more advanced repair tool – **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to help you.

#### Scan and repair your PC with Fortect’s automated one-stop solution

 Fortect is a legitimate tool that can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
