### Fix 1 – Do some basic troubleshooting

 To troubleshoot the temporary device glitches, you could try a few common workarounds:

* **Unplug your Oculus Rift S headset** and**plug it back to the computer** . This should make the headset work, but according to some users, this is only a temporary fix and you need to do the reconnection every time your computer restarts.
* **Try a different USB port** just in case the previous port you use is somehow broken or it can not provide enough power to your headset.

 If you go through the steps above but the problem persists, move on to the more complicated fixes below.

### Fix 2 – Update your device drivers

 The Oculus Rift S mic not working issue is likely to be driver-related. To keep your VR headset running in tip-top condition, you should update your device drivers on a regular basis.

### Fix 3 – Allow access to your microphone

 If you’re on Windows 10, one of the reasons for mic not working is that your microphone access has been disabled by accident. And you should allow the system and applications to use your Oculus Rift S microphone.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time.
2. On the Windows Settings menu, select**Privacy** .

### Fix 4 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Oculus Rift S headset mic will be set as the default input device once it’s correctly connected. But if it’s not, the mic won’t transmit your voice at all, and you should check the sound settings and make things right.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then, type**control** in the text field and click**OK** .

1. Type**device manager** in the search box and click**Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/device-manager.jpg)
