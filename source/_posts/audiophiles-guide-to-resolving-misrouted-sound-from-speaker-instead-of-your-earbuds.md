## Before delving into any advanced settings

 First, you should restart your computer. Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve temporary glitches or conflicts that may be causing the audio to cut out.

If your audio still cuts out after a restart, try these fixes:

1. **[Check the basics](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Run the audio troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable audio enhancements](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Restart audio services](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Repair your system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check the basics

 To efficiently identify the source of the problem, you need to confirm that your audio device is functioning properly. If you’re using external speakers, check the power source and connections. Check if they’re working properly on other devices.

 If you’re pretty sure that your speakers or headphones are in good condition, try the fixes below.

## 2\. Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates often address software bugs and compatibility issues that may contribute to the audio problem. To take advantage of bug fixes and system improvements that come with Windows updates, you can verify if you install all the available Windows updates. Below are the steps you take:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**check for updates** and click**Check for updates** from the list of results.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/win11-search-bar-check-for-updates.jpg)
2. Click on the button**Check for updates** . When available, follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Windows updates.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win11-check-for-updates.png)

Reboot your device and play the audio to see if your problem persists.

## 3\. Update audio drivers

 Outdated or incompatible audio drivers can cause audio issues. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now. Driver updates often tackle bugs, enhance compatibility, and improve performance.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Get driver updates from the manufacturer’s websites or via the Device Manager

 You can visit the manufacturer’s website for your sound card, find the driver version that corresponds with your system, and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the latest driver.

_Have no idea which sound card you have? Take these steps:_

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/win11-dxdiag.jpg)
3. Select the**Sound** tab and you should see the details of your sound card.

Or you can update your audio drivers through the Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
3. In the Device Manager window, find and double-click the**Sound, video and game controllers** category to expand it. Right-click on the audio device for which you want to update the driver. This could be your sound card or integrated audio device.
