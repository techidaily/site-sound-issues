### Fix 2 – Update your sound card driver

 The Zoom no sound issue may occur when you’re using the wrong sound card driver or it’s out-of-date. So you should update the audio driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways to get the correct drivers for your sound card:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 To update the audio driver manually, you can go to the official website of your device manufacturer, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download it manually.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
