### Fix 1: Disable other audio devices

 Usually we have connected more than one audio device to our PC, and this might be causing the cut-out issue — Windows sometimes can’t determine which is the active device. In this case, you can **disable all the audio devices except the one you’re using** .

Here’s how:

1. At the bottom right corner of your screen, right-click the speaker icon and select**Sounds** .

### Fix 3: Disable QoS High Packet Priority

 Some users reported that a Discord feature named**Quality of Service High Packet Priority** is causing lag spikes in game, and some specialists suggest that disabling this option could be a fix to the audio-cutting-out problem. You can try the same and see if there’s any improvement.

1. Open Discord and go to**User Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/discord-disable-qos-2.jpg)
3. Now test if the audio cuts out again.

 If this method doesn’t do the trick, you can continue to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 According to the feedback, the audio cutting out issue is very likely driver-related. In other words, it could mean that**the audio driver you’re using is broken or out of date** . For your PC to stay in the best shape, you should always make sure to have the latest drivers.

 You can update your audio driver manually, by visiting the PC/motherboard manufacturer’s website, searching for your model and downloading the latest correct installer. If you don’t have the time or patience to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot
