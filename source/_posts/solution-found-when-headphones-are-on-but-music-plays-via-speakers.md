## Solution 3: Update the audio driver

 If uninstalling driver doesn’t work, you might need to update the driver.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for sound card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your sound card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install the driver correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
