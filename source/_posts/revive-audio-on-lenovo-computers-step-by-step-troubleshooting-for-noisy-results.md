### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 If you can’t hear any sound while gaming on Apex Legends, chances are that you’re using a wrong or outdated audio driver. It’s essential that you have the latest correct audio driver at all times.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/2019-tips-apex-legends-no-sound/#c2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your sound card keeps updating the driver. To get it, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-113.png)

**3)**  Click the **Update button** next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 4: Restart Windows Audio Services

 Some audio issues can also be addressed by restarting Windows Audio Services. To see if that works for you, follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key and type**services** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-324.png)

**2)** Right-click**Windows Audio** , then select**Restart** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-326.png)

**3)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 This should allow you to hear Apex Legends and everything else. If your issue still exists, don’t fret. There is still one more fix to try.

### Fix 5: Reinstall Apex Legends

 If none of the fixes above helped, reinstalling Apex Legends is very likely the solution to your issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run**Origin** .

**2)** Click**My Game Library** , right-click**Apex Legends** and select**Uninstall** .
