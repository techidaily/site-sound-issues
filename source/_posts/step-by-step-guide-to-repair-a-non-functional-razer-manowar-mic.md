### **Fix 2: Update your audio driver**

 A missing or outdated audio driver in your computer can cause your Logitech G430 mic not working, so you should verify and keep your audio driver up to date.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update your driver** : you can go to your sound card manufacturer’s website, search for the latest version of your sound card driver, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update the driver** : if you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
