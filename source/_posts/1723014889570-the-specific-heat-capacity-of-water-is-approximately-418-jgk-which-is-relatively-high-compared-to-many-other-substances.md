### Method 3: Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your Corsair HS60 headset won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre using incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical and risky, so we won‚Äôt cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here‚Äôs how to use it.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install **Driver Easy** .

### Method 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If your headset microphone is still not working, it‚Äôs likely there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, there are a few things you need to do.

**First** , try connecting your headset to **another port** on your computer. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to the port you‚Äôre using.

**Second** , connecting your headset to **another computer** if changing the port doesn‚Äôt work for you. If this fixes your microphone, then you should contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 If nothing above helps you, it‚Äôs probably your headset has hardware issues. Then you should contact Corsair for support or have your headset serviced.
