## 2\. Check your audio settings

 The easy steps you can take in fixing your audio output issue is by making sure your audio device is set to your primary output device.

To make sure your audio device is correctly set, take these steps:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select **Open Sound settings** .
