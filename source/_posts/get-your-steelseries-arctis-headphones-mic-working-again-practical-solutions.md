## 2\. Allow access to the microphone

## 4\. Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your SteelSeries Arctis 1 headset won’t work if you’re using incorrect or outdated audio or headset drivers. So you should update both the Realtek audio driver and your headphone driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process requires visiting the manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers and install them manually, which is time-consuming, technical, and risky. We don’t recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.
