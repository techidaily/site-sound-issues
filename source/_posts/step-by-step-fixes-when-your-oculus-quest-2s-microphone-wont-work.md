 Also check if your**cable** is damaged. If your microphone or headset has a**mute switch** , make sure it’s unmuted. You can also try plugging in the cable again to see if it gives you any luck, or you can use your cellphone or another computer for audio testing.

 If there’s nothing wrong with your input device, check out the next method.

## Fix 2: Configure your system microphone settings

You can use these steps to check:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type or paste**ms-settings:sound** and click**OK** .

### Fix 4:**Update your audio driver**

 The voice chat issue could occur when you’re using a**faulty or outdated audio driver** . You should be sure that you’re using the latest audio driver, especially when you’ve spend top dollar for your peripherals, which often ship with edgy features that need to be unlocked by additional drivers.

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting each manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

 After updating your audio driver, restart your computer and check the voice chat in WoW.

 If updating the audio driver failed to solve your case, simply move on to the next method.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 includes 2 types of updates, which respectively offer security patches and a performance boost. Sometimes Windows updates fix the software or driver conflict automatically. Given this, your voice chat issue could be easily solved by updating your system.

By the way, it’s surprisingly easy to update too:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate** , then press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-windows-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then search and install the system updates automatically. Once it’s done, restart your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed**all** the system updates, repeat these steps until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click**Check for updates** .

 If your issue persists after installing system updates, please continue to the final fix.
