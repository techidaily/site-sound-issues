### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If you’ve been constantly running into mic not working with Rec Room or other apps, chances are that your audio driver is faulty or out-of-date. In this case, you should update the driver to keep your VR rig up and running, and there are two ways for you:

**Manually** : You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your device, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically (recommended)** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your VR headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 After the update completes, restart the PC and see if your audio issue gets fixed. If not, there is one more fix to try.

### Fix 5 – Close unnecessary background apps

 If you’re running multiple programs in the background, they might use your headset microphone, and thus prevent it from working with Rec Room. To see if that’s the cause, simply disable all unnecessary apps via the following steps:

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-10.jpg)
2. Right-click each application you want to close and click**End task** .

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Your Rec Room mic should be working normally now without other interruptions. If you’ve attempted all the fixes above but to no avail, you may want to**reinstall Rec Room** to solve potential program glitches.
