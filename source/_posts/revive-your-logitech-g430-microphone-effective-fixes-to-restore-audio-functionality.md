For desktop apps, make sure that **Allow desktop apps to access your microphone**  is turned **On** .

 After you’ve done all of these, try to use your webcam microphone and check if it’s working properly. If the issue persists, try the next fix below.

## 4\. Make sure your mic isn’t disabled

 Sometimes you may not notice that your microphone has accidentally been disabled. To check if that’s your case, take these steps:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

## 5\. Set your device as default

 When you’re using an external camera, you might need to set that device as the audio device in order to access the built-in microphone. Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But sometimes it just fails to do that and you have to set it manually:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=174416&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.easygifanimator.net/images/gif-animator.png" border="0">Easy GIF Animator is a powerful animated GIF editor and the top tool for creating animated pictures, banners, buttons and GIF videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-sound-settings.png)

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) Select the **Recording**  tab. Select your microphone and then click **Set Default > OK** .  
  
![set your device as the default](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/microphone.png)

 After applying changes, do a mic test to check if this method did the trick. If the microphone is still not working, you need to check the input sensitivity of your mic to ensure it is not too low or too high which could cause issues. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) In the Sound window (shown as the picture above), right-click the microphone and select**Properties** .

 2) Go to the**Levels** tab. Then, drag the slider to adjust the volume. While performing this step, you need to do a mic test at the same time.
