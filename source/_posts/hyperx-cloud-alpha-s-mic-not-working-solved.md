## 1\. Check the physical connections

 Your HyperX cloud Stinger might be accidentally muted or not connected correctly. It’s worth checking the mute settings and the connectors of your headset to make sure they’re seated properly.

1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.
2. Check if all your connections are rightly plugged in, including the extension cable connections. For the microphone, **ensure it’s plugged in all the way and not hanging loosely** .
3. Check the volume knob on the right ear and **make sure the mic is not muted or the volumes are not too low** .

## 2\. Allow access to your headset microphone

[I’m a Windows 10 user](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[I’m a Mac user](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

**To allow apps to access your Microphone on Windows 10**

 If you others hear your voice when you’re in the middle of a game or meeting, first make sure this app can access your microphone. Here’s how:

1. Click the**Start** menu button, and select the**Settings** icon.  
![Click the Start button](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-start.jpg)
2. Select **Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Privacy.jpg)
3. Click**Microphone** from the left pane.  
![click microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Microphone.jpg)
4. Click the**Change** button, and make sure the**Microphone for this device** option is**O** n.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/make-sure-its-on.jpg)
5. Scroll down and make sure the**Allow apps to access your microphone** is**On** .

6. Also, make sure the app you’re using now is turned on.  
![select the app you're using and turn it on](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/which-app.jpg)
7. Now check if HyperX Cloud Stinger’s microphone is working. If you have granted all the permissions to the microphone but you still can’t be heard, you can try the next fix.

**To allow apps to access your Microphone on a Mac**

1. Choose Apple menu ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/5E3B07C0094622B541F026E3/5E3B07C3094622B541F026EA/en_GB/2f77cc85238452e25cb517130188bf99.png) \>**System Preferences** , click**Sound** , then click**Input** .  
 (Note: _The options that appear depend on your Mac model and the audio devices plugged into your Mac._ )
2. Select your headphone in the list of sound input devices and adjust the volume to make sure it can record your voice.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/micro.png)
3. Then go to**System Preferences** \>**Security and Privacy** \>**Privacy** , and select**Microphone** from the sidebar. You should see a list of apps that have requested access to your microphone. Make sure you have approved the app you want to use the microphone with.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/privacy-microphone.jpg)

 If you can talk to Siri but this app still isn’t working, check the app’s preferences to see if there are separate settings for input devices. But if everything works just fine in other apps, you can try reinstalling this app.

## 3\. Check your microphone settings

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Then type**control** and press Enter.

## 4\. Update your audio drivers

 Another common cause of HyperX Cloud Stinger mic not working is the outdated or corrupt audio driver. HyperX Gaming keeps improving the firmware and drivers to enable better compatibility on PC, PS4, Xbox, etc.

## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.

## 6\. Check your HyperX Cloud Stinger in your game apps

 Sometimes the culprit may not be on your audio or control box settings, but in the game or app, you use instead. Check the audio settings in the game, or in the app, then confirm whether this will make your HyperX Cloud Stinger mic work again.
