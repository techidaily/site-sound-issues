### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of in-game sound issue is the**broken or outdated audio driver** . So you should update your audio driver to see it it fixes your problem.

 You can update your audio driver manually, by going to the manufacture website of your sound card and search for the latest driver for your exact module. But this takes quite a while. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
