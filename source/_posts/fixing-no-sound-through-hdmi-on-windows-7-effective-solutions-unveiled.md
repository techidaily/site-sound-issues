 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.
