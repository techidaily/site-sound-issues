## 2\. Set your speakers as the default

 When you connect the external speakers to your computer, your system would recognize it. But there are some situations where the sound may not come from your external speakers. That’s because your device isn’t set as the default audio playback device that Windows uses to output sound. In this case, you need to manually set your speakers as the default:

1. From the bottom-right corner of your screen, right-click on the Speaker icon and select**Open Sound settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-sound-settings.png)
2. Click**Sound Control Panel** .![open sound control panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sound-control-panel.png)
3. Under the**Playback** tab, click on your Creative Pebble speakers and click**Set Default** .

 Once you’ve done that, verify via the speaker icon in the taskbar that the audio is not muted and is turned up. Then you can test by playing a song. If your Creative Pebble speakers still won’t produce any sound, don’t worry, there are a few other fixes you can try.

## 3\. Update your sound driver

 If you are experiencing audio issues, you may need to check if your sound card driver is outdated or faulty.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can head to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card to download and install the latest driver for your system.
