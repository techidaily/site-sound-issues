## Fix 2: Disable audio enhancement

 Audio enhancement is designed to make your system sound perfect. But things can go wrong somethings. To fix your sound stuttering problem, please perform:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** \+ **R** on the keyboard at the same time.
2. Type **mmsys.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sound-1.jpg)

 If you don’t have an Enhancement tab here, the culprit is not enhancement then. Move on to the next fix.

## Fix 3: Change audio formats

 If your audio driver or software doesn’t support the current audio format you have, sound issues such as static or stuttering would happen. To fix it, you can try different audio formats:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** \+ **R** on the keyboard at the same time.
2. Type “mmsys.cpl” and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/mmsyssound.jpg)
3. Right-click your default playback device (the one with a green tick) and click **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/sound.jpg)
4. Click the **Advanced** tab. Select **16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality)** . Click **Apply** and **OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/speaker.jpg)
5. Test to see if your sound is still stuttering. If yes, go back to step 4 and try some other formats until you find the one that works for you.

 If your audio problem remains, don’t worry, you need to update your audio drivers. Move on to method 4 for help.
