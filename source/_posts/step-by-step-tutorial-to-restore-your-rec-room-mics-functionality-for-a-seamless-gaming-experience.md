### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes the mic on your**LusidSound LS30** won’t work simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) On the lower-right of your computer screen, click**the sound icon** and move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.

### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-139.png)

 2) Click the **Recording** tab, then click on **your microphone device** and click **Set Default** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-140.png)

 If **no microphone devices shows up in the device list** , then right-click on **the empty space** and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on **the microphone device** once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .  

 3) Click on **your microphone device** and click **Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-141.png)

 4) Click the **Levels** tab, then drag **the Microphone slider** all the way to _its top_ and click **OK** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/image-137.png)

 5) Click **OK** to apply the changes in the windows.

 6) Now with microphone set as default device and the volume turned up, try playing some audio on your LS30 headset and see if it works. If it does, then the **LucidSound LS30 mic not working** problem is solved. If no, don’t worry. There’s one more fix for you to try.
