## Troubleshoot Your PC's Audio Problems in Just Five Simple Steps

If you’re on Windows 10 and you find that your audio or sound is not working properly, you’re not alone. Many Windows users are reporting that their sound is not working or chopping and so many more problems.

 But no worries, it’s usually not a hard problem to solve. Here are 5 of the most effective methods that will help you with not working audio problem. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down and find the one works for you.

 Method 1:[**Check cable connection and volume**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 2:[**Turn off Audio Enhancements**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 3:[**Update sound driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 4:[**Uninstall driver via Device Manager**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
 Method 5:[**Try generic audio driver provided by Windows 10**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 1: Check cable connection and volume  

 Before we do any changes to the software, we need to rule out some possible human error. So please check to see if:

 1) your speaker and headphone connections are with loose cables or wrong jack;

 2) your power and volume controls are up;

 3) the volume controls on the apps are on and up;

 4) headphones are plugged in: your speakers might not work if you have the headphones in.

## 2: Turn off Audio Enhancements  

 Audio enhancement feature is supposed to make your sound card work at its peak, but unfortunately, not all sound card hardware work well when it’s on. You can turn it off by:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, type**control** in and press**Enter.**

 2) View by **Large icons** , click **Sound** .

 5) See if your sound is back. If you still cannot get your sound back, choose Cancel here, and then repeat 2) and 3) with your other default device and have a try again.

## 3: Update sound driver

 If no good signs are shown after the first two methods, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your sound or audio card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your audio card, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10\.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do so automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the audio device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).
