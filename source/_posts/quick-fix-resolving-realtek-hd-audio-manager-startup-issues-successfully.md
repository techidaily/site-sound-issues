### Fix 1: Update the Realtek HD Audio driver

There are two ways you can update your Realtek HD Audio driver.

[**Option 1 – Manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your Realtek HD Audio driver this way, because you’ll need to find the driver that’s compatible with your exact audio device model and your version of Windows, then download and install the driver step-by-step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/realtek-hd-audio-manager-not-opening-solved/#o2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. You’re all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Realtek keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the **[Realtek](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsCheck.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=24&PFid=24&Level=4&Conn=3&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false)**  website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.  
  
 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update Realtek HD Audio drivers
