### Method 1: Check cable and volumes

 If you don’t hear sound from your external audio devices, like speakers and headphones, you can check if their cable is broken. You can plug them to in another computer and see if they work in another computer. If they work in another computer, the problem is probably caused by the cable.

 If the audio device has been muted, you won’t hear sound from it. Check if your speaker or headphone has been muted by accident.

### Method 2: Check your speaker settings

1. Right-click the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your desktop and click **Playback devices** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_570b4f3700616.png)
2. In the**Playback** tab, ensure there’s a green tick on**Speakers** . This indicates that your speakers are the default playback device.  
![Default speaker ticked Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Default-speaker-ticked-Windows10.png)  

 If your Speakers are NOT already set as the default, this is doubtless your problem. To fix, just click them, click**Set Default** , then click **OK** and test whether you have sound.  
![Set default speakers Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Set-default-speakers-Windows-10.png)  

 If your Speakers are set as the default playback device, and you’re still not hearing any sound, you should experiment with different sound formats. To do this, click**Speakers** then **Properties** .  
![Change speaker sound format Windows 10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Change-speaker-sound-format-Windows-10.png)
3. Go to the **Advanced** tab, and in the**Default Format** section, select a different sample rate and bit depth, then click**Test** . Repeat this process until you find a format that works, then click**OK** . If you don’t find a format that works, proceed to[Method 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

### Method 3: Uninstall your audio driver

 If your sound driver has somehow been removed, corrupted or become incompatible with Windows 10, you won’t be able to hear any sound from your speakers. (This quite often happens after an upgrade to Windows 10 from an earlier version of Windows.)

 The simplest way to check if this is what has happened is to uninstall your audio driver:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** (at the same time) to invoke the quick-access menu.
2. Click **Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2-9.jpg)
3. In Device Manager, expand**Sound, video and game controllers** , right-click on your sound card, and click **Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_57355165cc4c9.png)
4. If you’re asked to confirm the uninstall, check the**Delete the driver software for this device** box and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/img_573551f5c1434.png)
5. Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved. If it’s not, move on to[Method 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) below.

### Method 4: Update your audio driver

 If experimenting with different sound formats and uninstalling your audio driver didn’t bring back your sound in Windows 10, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong audio driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right audio driver: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10\.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct audio driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install it correctly :

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5949d2f95d64f.png)
3. Click the **Update** button next to a flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version of Driver Easy).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_5949d31484e2f.jpg)  
 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **Pro** version which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

4. Restart your computer and check to see if you now have sound.

### Method 5: Disable audio enhancements

 Audio enhancements can cause audio issues. To fix no sound issues in Windows 10, you can try to turn off audio enhancements.

To do so, follow these steps:

 1) Open[Control Panel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2) View by Small icon, and select**Sound** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-272.png)

 3) Select one**Default Device** and select**Properties** .

In the example below, the default device is Speakers / Headphones.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-275.png)

 4) On the**Enhancements** tab,**select** the**Disable all enhancements** check box. Then click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-276.png)

5) Check to see if the sound issue is resolved.

**Note** if you have multiple default devices, you may need to repeat the steps above for each default device until the sound issue is resolved.
