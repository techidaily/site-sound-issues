Before you start, make sure your headset is working properly.

## Try these fixes

## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 You can update the audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website and downloading the correct driver. Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.
