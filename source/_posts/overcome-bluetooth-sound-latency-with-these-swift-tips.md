### Fix 1: Try some easy troubleshooting tips

 Before we dive into other fixes, try some easy troubleshooting tips first.

1. **Check which Bluetooth version** your Bluetooth audio device supports. If it only supports **Bluetooth 2.0** , you may probably suffer from the audio lag issue, because the small bandwidth will lag the audio stream of high bit rate. If so, you may need to replace it with a new one that supports **Bluetooth 4.0** .
2. **Check the battery of your Bluetooth audio device** . Make sure its battery is sufficient enough for the connection.
3. Place your Bluetooth audio device **close to** your PC to ensure a stable connection.
4. Turn off any other nearby Bluetooth devices to **reduce the interference** .

See if Bluetooth audio lags or not. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Reconnect your Bluetooth audio device to your PC

 This is the quickest and easiest fix to try when you run into Bluetooth audio lag issue. Just turn off your Bluetooth audio device and then turn it on to reconnect your Bluetooth audio device to your PC.

 If Bluetooth audio still lags, try removing it first. Then pair it to your PC again. If you don’t know how to pair your Bluetooth audio device to your PC, you can refer to the article: **[ Sony Bluetooth Headphones Pairing \[Step by Step\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 See if the audio lag issue persists. If the audio still laggy, don’t worry. Try the next fix, below.
