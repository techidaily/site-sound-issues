## Fix 6: Repair your system files

 It’s possible that Bluetooth not working issue is caused by a Windows system error. Corrupt, damaged, or missing system files can cause Windows issues. To check if this is the exact cause, you can either use the Windows built-in tool to run a basic check or use an automatic tool to perform a complete diagnosis.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/windows-11-bluetooth-not-working/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fit for you.
* [Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

 If you prefer efficiency, **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a professional Windows repair tool that can scan your system and fix it in one click. It is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way.

Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.
