### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

### Fix 3: Make sure your microphone is set as default in Windows

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes you’ll have to manually set it as default.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20To%20Fix%20Fortnite%20Sound%20Not%20Working%20-%20https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-fortnite-sound-not-working-on-pc/) **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and R at the same time, then type **ms-settings:sound** and press **Enter** to open Control Panel.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-239.png)

 4) In **Sound** settings, scroll down to the**Input** section, and in**Choose your input device** , make sure the microphone you are actively using is selected. Then,**test your microphone** by speaking into your mic to see if it ‘hears’ anything. If yes, it means you have configured the microphone properly.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-260.png)

### Fix 5: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Apex Legends, EA, keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required for the problem. So it’s recommended that you go to[**EA official website**](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) , check for the latest patch, download and install it. Then check if it fixes the voice chat not working problem.

 If there is no patches available, or the patch fails to address the problem, then please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Reinstall Origin and Apex Legends

 If the above steps don’t solve the issue, then it’s likely that the files in Origin or Apex Legends are corrupt. So you can reinstall the client and the game to see if it solves the problem.

Here are the steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **appwiz.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-174.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
