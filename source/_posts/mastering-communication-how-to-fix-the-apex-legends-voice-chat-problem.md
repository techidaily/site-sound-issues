### Fix 1: Allow Origin to access your microphone

 Here are the steps to grant Origin access to the microphone on your computer:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and type**microphone** . Then click on**Microphone privacy settings** .

### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

### Fix 3: Make sure your microphone is set as default in Windows

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes you’ll have to manually set it as default.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20To%20Fix%20Fortnite%20Sound%20Not%20Working%20-%20https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-fortnite-sound-not-working-on-pc/) **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and R at the same time, then type **ms-settings:sound** and press **Enter** to open Control Panel.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-239.png)

 4) In **Sound** settings, scroll down to the**Input** section, and in**Choose your input device** , make sure the microphone you are actively using is selected. Then,**test your microphone** by speaking into your mic to see if it ‘hears’ anything. If yes, it means you have configured the microphone properly.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-242.png)

5) Close the window.

6) Launch Apex Legends to see if the mic not working problem is fixed. If yes, then congrats! If the issue persists, please try**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 4: Configure in-game settings

 It is also important that you configured the audio settings right in order for the microphone to work properly.

Here is how to configure in-game settings:

 1) In Origin, click**Origin** \>**Application Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-260.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) Click**More** \>**VOICE** , then make sure**the microphone you’re using is selected** and**Microphone volum** e is set to**an audio volume** . After that, in**Activation mode** , choose**Push-to-talk** .

 3) Open Apex Legends, then go to**Settings > AUDIO** and set the **Voice Chat Record Mode** to **Push to Talk** .

### Fix 5: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Apex Legends, EA, keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required for the problem. So it’s recommended that you go to[**EA official website**](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) , check for the latest patch, download and install it. Then check if it fixes the voice chat not working problem.

 If there is no patches available, or the patch fails to address the problem, then please try **Fix 6** , below.

---

### Fix 6: Reinstall Origin and Apex Legends

 If the above steps don’t solve the issue, then it’s likely that the files in Origin or Apex Legends are corrupt. So you can reinstall the client and the game to see if it solves the problem.

Here are the steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **appwiz.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-174.png)

 2) In the program list, locate **Origin** , then right-click on it and click **Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-175-1024x499.png)

 4) Locate **Apex Legends** and uninstall it too.

 5) Restart your computer.

 6) Download and install Origin from **[its official website](https://www.origin.com/)**  .
