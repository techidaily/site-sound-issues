### Fix 3 – Update your audio driver

 If you’re using the wrong audio driver or it’s out-of-date, the SteelSeries Arctis 7 mic-not-working issue is likely to occur. To make your audio devices work properly at all times, it’s necessary to keep your audio driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest audio driver from **[SteelSeries’s website](https://support.steelseries.com/hc/en-us)**  , and install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 The right and up-to-date driver should make your SteelSeries Arctis 7 headset run at the best status. But if the issue persists, keep on troubleshooting with the fixes below.

### Fix 4 – Allow access to your SteelSeries Arctis 7 microphone

 If your SteelSeries Arctis 7 mic refuses to work after a new system update, it’s likely Windows has disabled the apps from accessing your microphone. If so, you need to allow the permission manually.

 This method only applies to Windows 10 and Windows 8\. Windows 7 users can directly jump to **[Fix 5](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Windows Settings menu.

**2)** Click**Privacy** .

### Fix 5 – Reinstall the SteelSeries Engine software

 The SteelSeries Engine software offers users better control over their SteelSeries gaming devices, but sometimes the app updates can mess with your SteelSeries Arctis headset. In this case, try to reinstall the program to cure the mic not working problem.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open Run command. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-2-8.jpg)

**2)** Right-click**SteelSeries Engine** and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-3-7.jpg)

**3)** Go to the **[SteelSeries official website](https://steelseries.com/engine)**  .

**4)** Click**Windows** to download the latest version of SteelSeries Engine.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1-8.jpg)

**5)** Follow the on-screen instruction to install the SteelSeries Engine software.

**6)** Reconnect your SteelSeries Arctis 7 headset to the computer.

It should be automatically detected and function normally.

 If all the fixes above couldn’t get your SteelSeries Arctis 7 mic working, then check whether your headset is physically broken. Simply try it on another PC. If it doesn’t work either, you’re suggested to ask the vendor for further assistance.
