### Fix 5 – Reinstall the SteelSeries Engine software

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open Run command. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-2-8.jpg)

**2)** Right-click**SteelSeries Engine** and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-3-7.jpg)

**3)** Go to the **[SteelSeries official website](https://steelseries.com/engine)**  .

**4)** Click**Windows** to download the latest version of SteelSeries Engine.

**5)** Follow the on-screen instruction to install the SteelSeries Engine software.

**6)** Reconnect your SteelSeries Arctis 7 headset to the computer.

It should be automatically detected and function normally.
