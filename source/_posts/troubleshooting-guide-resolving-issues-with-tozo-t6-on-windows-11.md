### Fix 1: Update your audio driver

 It’s likely your audio driver becomes incompatible after upgrading Windows system, so it’s recommended to update your audio driver to fix the no sound issue.

 There are two ways you can get the right audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
