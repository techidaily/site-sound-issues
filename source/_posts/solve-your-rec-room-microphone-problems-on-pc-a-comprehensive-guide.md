## Method 1: Check your microphone device settings

**1) Hold down the Windows logo** **key**  and**press the R** **key** on your keyboard at the same time to bring up the Run dialog, then type “_**control**_ ” and press **Enter** .

 Now that the microphone of your headset is enabled and set as the default device, and you’ve turned up your microphone volume, try it and see if it works. If it does, then you’ve solved the problem. But if not, you may need to…

## Method 2: Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your Razer Kraken headset won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time consuming, technical and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

**1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install**Driver Easy** .

**2)**  Run**Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.**Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 You can also click the **Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)

 Once you’ve updated the driver for your Razer Kraken headset, restart your computer. Then log in again and see if the microphone is working.
