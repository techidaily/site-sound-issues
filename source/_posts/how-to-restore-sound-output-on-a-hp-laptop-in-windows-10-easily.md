 5) Restart your computer and Windows will automatically download and install the sound driver for your device. After that, check the sound to see if it works.

### Fix 5: Check for corrupted system files

 Over time, your Windows system files can become corrupted or damaged from various issues like software conflicts, malware infections, buggy updates, improper shutdowns, and more. With corrupted system files, you may encounter audio glitches, sound distortion, or no audio at all from HP devices.

 System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows tool that scans system files and replaces corrupted ones with their original working copies. To run SFC:

1) Open the Command Prompt as admin.

2) Type “sfc /scannow” and hit enter

3) Restart your computer once finished.

 Alternatively, utilities like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comprehensively scan your entire system for stability issues, damaged files, malware infections, and more. Fortect then repairs corrupted Windows files by replacing them with healthy versions without deleting user data. This**automated repair** process restores system stability and functionality.

 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you **a detailed report of your PC status** .
