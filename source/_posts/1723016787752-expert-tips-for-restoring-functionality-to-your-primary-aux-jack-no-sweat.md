### Method 3: Try the back audio jacks

 You may have hardware issues with your front audio jacks. So it’s worth checking the audio jacks on your motherboard to see if your issues are occurring on your front jack only.

 Try connecting your audio device to the audio jacks on the back of your computer. If your audio device works properly, then the problem is on your front audio jack. You may need to contact your computer manufacturer for advice or bring your computer to an authorized service provider to have it serviced.
