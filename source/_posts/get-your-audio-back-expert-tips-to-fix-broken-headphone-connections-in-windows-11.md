1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows key** and**X** at the same time, then choose**Device Manager** .

2. Double-click**Sound, video, and game controllers** . Then right-click the audio device driver that you have and choose**Update driver** .

3. Choose**Browse my computer for driver software** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594a28445c675.png)
4. Then choose**Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594a286f3d5de.png)
5. Make sure the box for**Show compatible hardware** is**TICKED** . Then choose**High Definition Audio Device** from the list, and hit**Next** to continue.

6. You will see the warning asking you whether you want to go on with the installation, click**Yes** to continue.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/img_594a294398588.png)
7. Restart your computer when the installation finishes.

 If the generic audio driver doesn’t work to fix the sound cutting out issue, it’s possible that you have a corrupted or outdated sound card driver, so you should update the driver to see if it helps. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
