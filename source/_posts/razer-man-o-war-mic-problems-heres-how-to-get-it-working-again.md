### Fix 1: Check your Sound settings

 Usually Windows will identify your plugged-in headset as the default playback/recording device, but that’s not always the case. To see if there’s anything wrong with the settings for your Razer ManO’War, please perform the following procedure:

 1) Click the speaker icon![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-26_14-41-05.jpg) in the notification area of your task bar. Then click**Sounds** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-101.png)

 2) Go to the**Recording** tab, right-click an empty area inside the devices’ display list, and then tick**Show Disabled Devices** to ensure that your headset shows up.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-103.png)

 3) Click to highlight**Razer ManO’War** , then click**Set Default > Default Device** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-115.png)

 You can also right-click**Razer ManO’War** and check if it is disabled. If it is, select**Enable** to get your mic working.

 4) Right-click**Razer ManO’War** and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-106.png)

 On the**Levels** tab, see if your mic is muted. In case it is (as shown in the following screenshot), click on the little speaker icon to unmute your mic. On completion, click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-116.png)

 5) Click**OK** to save all the changes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-117.png)

 Now check to see if your Razer ManO’War mic is working properly. If it isn’t, please move on to**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Modify Privacy settings

 There’s a possibility that your privacy settings related to the microphone has been reset after a Windows Update or other system events. If so, some programs (e.g. a video game) might be forbidden to access your mic. Here’s how to check and modify these settings:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to fire up the **Settings** window. Then, select **Privacy** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-365.png)

 2) On the**Microphone** tab, in the results pane, click **Change** to see if**Microphone access for this device** is toggled on. If it isn’t, make sure you toggle it on.

 Right below you’ll see another toggle for **Allow apps to access your microphone** . Also remember to turn it on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Scroll down and head to the part of **Choose which apps can access your microphone** . Make sure you**toggle on** the apps in which you want to use the mic.

### Fix 3: Reinstall Razer Synapse

 Razer Synapse is a piece of configuration software developed by Razer to help you better control your Razer peripherals. To know more about its features, please refer to the[**official introduction**](https://www.razer.com/synapse-2#:~:targetText=Razer%20Synapse%20is%20our%20unified,settings%20automatically%20to%20the%20cloud.) of Razer Synapse.

 Dumb as it sounds, reinstalling Razer Synapse would work wonders in some cases (especially after you updated your operating system to Windows 10). If you’ve never used this app, simply try installing it on your computer and then test the mic.

 1) If you’ve already had Razer Synapse installed, please**uninstall** it first.

 2) Go to the **[support center](https://support.razer.com/)**  of Razer. Under**Select a product** , click**Headsets & Audio** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-109.png)

 3) On the next page, scroll down and select**Razer ManO’War** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-110.png)

 4) Click**View software, drivers and updates for download >** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 5) Find the one compatible with your operating system, and click**Download** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 After downloading the correct file, install it on your PC. Then, launch Razer Synapse and configure the settings for your Razer ManO’War mic. Check to see whether your mic has gone back to normal; if it hasn’t, then please give the next fix a shot.

### Fix 4: Update your device drivers

 Sometimes an out-dated or corrupt device driver (e.g., audio drivers, CPU drivers) may give rise to the mic-not-working issue. The reasons can hardly be elaborated, but chances are your Razer ManO’War mic may be messed up with its drivers or those of other hardware components. If you’re not sure whether all your device drivers are up-to-date, you should check.

 You can do this in Windows Device Manager, one device at a time. But this takes a lot of time and patience, and if any of your drivers do happen to be out of date, you’ll need to manually update them, which is difficult and risky. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually,   **you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-07-15_14-27-17.png)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or if you just want to update your audio driver for now, simply click the **Update**  button next to it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-7.png)

**Note:** you can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you have any problems using Driver Easy to update your driver, please feel free to email us at **<support@drivereasy.com>** . We’re always here to help.

### Fix 5: Check for hardware malfunction

 If none of the above fixes work, you should do some basic check and find out whether your Razer ManO’War mic fails. Here’s something you may need to do:

* Plug your headset into other ports, and then test whether the mic continues to stop working;
* If you have more than one computer at hand, try to use the mic on other computers and see if it works properly;
* Make sure you don’t use the Razer ManO’War with a**USB3.0 enabled device** at the same time (if you must use them simultaneously, then don’t place them in close proximity to each other);
* If your computer has both an audio jack and a microphone jack, you may need to use an**Audio/Mic splitter adapter** (you can look it up on Amazon or other online stores) to get your mic working.

 If, after taking all these steps your mic remains not working, you should probably contact Razer for further assistance or go to a repair shop.
