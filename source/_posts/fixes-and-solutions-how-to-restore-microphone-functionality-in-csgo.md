 It is best practice to set your microphone as the default device when you come across the mic-not-working issue. To do so, you need to perform the following procedure:

1. At the bottom right corner of your computer screen – namely the notification area – you’ll find the**volume icon** . Right-click on it and select**Sound settings** .

 Also, if you have other output devices, go to the**Playback** tab and disable them (except the one in use) in the same way as you did on the**Recording** tab.
8. After everything’s done, click**OK** to save the changes.

## Fix 3: Check in-game settings

1. Launch CS:GO and click the gear icon in the left pane.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-338.png)
2. Go to the**Audio Settings** tab and select**Audio** below. Then, pay attention to the related audio settings and make certain they are**turned on** or set to the correct state.

## Fix 4: Update device drivers

 Sometimes an outdated, corrupt or incompatible driver may trigger the mic-not-working issue. If that’s the root cause, you should try to update not only the audio drivers but also drivers for other motherboard devices like chipsets.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

## Fix 5: Verify integrity of game cache files

 This is a quick fix for most problems occurring in Steam games, so it not only applies to CS:GO but also to other games when necessary. Here are the steps that help you verify the integrity of your game cache files:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on your game and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Installed Files** tab and click on the**Verified integrity of game files** button.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 Once you verify that all the cache files are in normal state, please launch CS:GO and check if your mic is working properly this time. In case the problem persists, you should move on to the next fix.

---

## Fix 6: Restart the Windows Audio service

 Chances are your Windows Audio service is running into glitches that prevent the mic from working normally. In this case you should restart the service and see if that gets your mic back on track.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Check Privacy settings

 There’s a possibility that your privacy settings related to the microphone has been reset after a Windows update or other events. If that’s the case, CS:GO might be forbidden to access your mic. To modify the privacy settings, you should perform the following procedure:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5ae0331bc08e4-2.png) and**I** at the same time to open the**Settings** window. Then, select**Privacy** and**Microphone** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-settings-privacy-microphone.jpg)
2. Check if the Microphone access button is Off. If so, simply turn it**On** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-settings-privacy-microphone-access.jpg)
3. Below you’ll see another toggle for**Let apps access your microphone** . Also turn it on if it’s been set to**Off** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-settings-privacy-microphone-access-1.jpg)
4. Scroll down and head to the part of**Choose which apps can access your microphone** . You won’t see Steam or CS:GO there but you can toggle on the apps related to your audio output. For instance, if you use Skype to communicate in games, make sure you turn its toggle on.

 After making these tweaks, check to see if your mic goes back to normal in CS:GO. If not, there’s still one last fix you may try.

![win 11 command prompt to run sfc 1](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-command-prompt-run-sfc-1.jpg)
3. It’ll take some time for the SFC to repair the corrupted system files if it detects any.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-command-prompt-run-sfc-3.png)
4. When the process is completed, reboot your computer and test if the issue still exists.

 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files, so please be patient.
