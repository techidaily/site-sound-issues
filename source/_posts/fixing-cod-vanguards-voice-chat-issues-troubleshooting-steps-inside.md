1\. Run the Epic Games Launcher.

 2\. On the left panel, click **Library** . On the right, click **the gear button** on the lower-right corner of **Fortnite** .

 Run Fortnite again to check whether your chat problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to Fix 4, below.

### Fix 4: Make sure your microphone is on for Fortnite

 If you downloaded Fortnite from**the Microsoft Store** , check if it has permission to use your microphone. Here’s how to do it:

 1\. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap427.jpg)

3\. Run Fortnite to see if chat works now. If not, try Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.
