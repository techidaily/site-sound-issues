## Before we move further…

 When we say Nvidia High Definition audio has no sound or is not working, we’re saying that the external monitor, which has its own speakers, doesn’t have sound coming out. But your other monitor(s), or the main screen if you’re using a laptop, still has sound. We don’t mean that your computer has no sound at all, as it should be another problem, most likely with your Realtek sound card. If your computer has no sou-nd whatsoever, here are some posts for you:

* [   **\[Fixed\] No Sound on Computer – Quickly & Easily** ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**How to Fix “No Audio Output Device is Installed” Error in Windows 10/11**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**5 Steps to Fix Sound/ Audio Issues on Windows 10**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 This is because Nvidia High Definition Audio, which comes with the Nvidia display card, is in charge of the monitor audio system, unlike the Realtek sound card: the latter is usually for the overall computer sound system, as it always comes with the motherboard, while the former is for display (your monitor) audio. You see, these two sound cards, Nvidia and Realtek, are in charge of different audio systems on your computer.

 If your computer problem fits the description here, please move on to see what fixes we have to offer for the Nvidia HD audio no sound issue.

## 1\. Make sure your monitor has built-in speakers

 When you find that your monitor has no sound coming out from the Nvidia High Definition audio device, especially when it’s new, you should first make sure that this monitor has built-in speakers. This may sound unbelievable, but it does happen to quite a few users.

 To see if your monitor has built-in speakers, the easiest way would be to check its user manual. Just search on Google for the model of your monitor plus user manual, and there, you have the information you need.

 Going to the purchase page of your monitor is also an easy way to get such information. For instance, this is the monitor purchase page for mine, and you can see the speaker information here:

## 2\. Check the display cable

 When you’ve made sure that your monitor comes with speakers, but the Nvidia High Definition Audio has no sound, i.e. the monitor doesn’t have sound coming out from it, please make sure that the display cable (HDMI, DP, mini-DP, etc) you’re using is working fine.

 To test the display cable, you can use it on a second monitor that also has speakers built-in and see if the Nvidia HD audio works for it. If the second monitor still has no sound coming out from its speaker, in other words, the Nvidia High Definition Audio has no sound even with a second monitor, then the problem should be with your display cable. In this case, you need to buy a new cable for the Nvidia HD audio to work again.

 Please note that a VGA cable doesn’t transfer audio data, so if the cable you have for your monitor is VGA, this is the problem. You’ll need an HDMI, DP, or mini-DP cable for the audio to go through.

## 3\. Make sure the sound output device is correctly set

 Some monitors require a further setup for their speakers to work properly. So if you find that your Nvidia HD audio has no sound, please press the**Windows** key, the**Ctrl** , and the**V** keys together to open the sound output device settings like this:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-56.png)

 Select NVIDIA High Definition Audio as the output device

 Select Nvidia High Definition Audio from the last if you can see it. If you don’t have this option, please move on.

## 4\. Try the generic Windows driver

 If the above doesn’t help to fix the NVIDIA High Definition Audio no sound problem, you can try the generic driver provided by Windows to see if it helps. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-22.png)
2. Double-click to expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** category, then right-click your**NVIDIA High Definition Audio** and select**Update driver** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-57.png)
3. Select **Browse my computer for drivers** .

## 5\. Clean install the Nvidia graphics card driver

 An outdated or incorrect sound card driver could also be the culprit to your NVIDIA High Definition Audio no sound problem, so if the above methods don’t help to fix the audio problem, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated sound card driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

 Given that the NVIDIA HD Audio driver comes with its display card driver, and it’s quite hard to get the audio driver separated from the graphics one, as such, we’re up for a clean install of the Nvidia display card driver.

To do so:

1. Click the **Windows start menu** and type **msconfig** , then click **Open** :

6. Tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png)
7. Then update your graphics card driver.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.
