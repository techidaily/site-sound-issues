## Fixing Persistent Audio Glitches on Your PC: Solutions Inside

If you’re on Windows 10 or Windows 7, and you’re hearing a popping sound coming out from your speaker and/or your headphones, you’re not alone. We’ve received reports from many Windows users reporting it. But no worries, you can get it fixed.

## **How do I fix it?**

 Here are 3 solutions you can try to get this problem fixed. You may not need to try them all. Just work from the top down until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Set Minimum Processor State to 100%](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable ATI HDMI Audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. [**DPC Latency**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Note: The screens shown below are from Windows 10, but all the fixes apply to Windows 11 as well.

## **1\. Set Minimum Processor State to 100%**

 Popping sound from your speakers or headphones could relate to your driver’s problem. To fix it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **S** at the same time and then type in **control** . Select **Control Panel** from the list.

 5) Click the **+** button to expand **Processor power management** . Then expand **Minimum processor state** in this way as well. Change the **Setting** (%) to **100** . Then click **Apply** and **OK** to save the change.

6) Check to see if your audio crackling problem is gone.

## **2\. Disable ATI HDMI Audio**

 In some cases, ATI HDMI Audio device in your Device Manager could be the culprit of the popping sound on your Windows PC. You can disable it for your audio to go back to normal again. To do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then choose **Device Manager** .

 2) Click to expand **Sound, video and game controllers** category. Right-click ATI HDMI Audio device driver if you can see it here and select **Disable device** .

If you don’t see this option here, move on to the next steps.

## **3\. DPC Latency**

 In some cases, high latency could be the cause of your static audio among many other audio problems. Luckily, there’s a handy tool called **DPC Latency Checker** . It helps monitor your PC performance and tells you what’s causing the latency.

 1) Download[**DPC Latency Checker**](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) and click the download file to open it.

 2) If you’re seeing green bars as shown in the screenshot below, and nothing in the top red section, your PC is in a good state. Move on to the next step below.

 3) If this screenshot is different from what you’re seeing, you’ll also see which device is causing the latency like this:

 Try disabling your device drivers from Device Manager as shown in **[Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  one by one.

 If you find disabling certain drivers reduce the latency a lot, then you have to reinstall the device drivers to the latest version. You can update all the needed device drivers one by one by yourself.
