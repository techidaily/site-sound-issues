## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the fix that works.

1. **[Allow access to your mic on your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Reinstall Logitech Gaming Software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Try an external sound card](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Run the audio troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Before you begin

 Before you start trying the fixes below, you should simply have a basic check on your headset as follows:

* Check the physical mute button on the left earcup to make sure that your headset is not muted.
* Charge the headset to check if it has run out of battery.
