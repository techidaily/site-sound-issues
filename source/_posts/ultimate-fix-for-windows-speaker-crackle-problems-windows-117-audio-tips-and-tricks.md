## Fix 4: Update**your sound card driver**

 If the 1-3 fixes didn’t solve your issue, make sure to update your sound card driver.

 To update the sound driver, you can choose to use Device Manager again. Microsoft can find the latest driver for you. But for some reason, sometimes Microsoft cannot detect the latest driver. As a result, it told you: The best driver software for your device is already installed.

It has two versions. Have a try on its **[Free Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , it will offer the latest drivers for you to install.
