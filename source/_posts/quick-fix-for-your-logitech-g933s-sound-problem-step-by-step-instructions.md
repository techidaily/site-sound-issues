 1) Make sure to check your **LusidSound LS30** headset for loose cables or the wrong jack.

 2) Try connecting your **LusidSound LS30** to a different port and see if this fixes the problem.

### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes the mic on your**LusidSound LS30** won’t work simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) On the lower-right of your computer screen, click**the sound icon** and move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.

To do so:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .
