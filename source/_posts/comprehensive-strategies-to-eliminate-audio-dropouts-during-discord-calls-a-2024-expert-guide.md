## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.
