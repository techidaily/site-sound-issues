## How to fix League of Legends Voice Chat Not Working

 Here are four fixes that have helped other users resolve the voice chat not working problem in LoL. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

 Whether it is that you cannot hear your friends, or you can’t get heard, the first thing you should check is whether your headset is connected properly.

 You should make sure the volume is set to an audible level, check that the cables (if you have a wired headphone device) are not worn out or loosely connected, and ensure that they’re plugged into the right port etc.

 Once you have double-checked these items, test the voice chat feature in LoL to see if it works. If yes, then great! If the problem persists, please move on to**Fix 2** below.

### Fix 2: Join voice channel automatically

 Here is how to do it:

### Fix 4: Update your audio drivers

 Your voice chat not working in LoL problem is probably being caused by driver issues. The steps above may resolve it, but if they don’t, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy takes care of it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audio.png)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
