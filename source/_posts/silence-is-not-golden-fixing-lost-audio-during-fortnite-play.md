### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap925.png)

 ii. Click**the speaker icon** to view the audio settings. Then**turn off Voice Chat** and click**Apply** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap431-1024x576.jpg)

iii. Exit Fortnite.

 2\. On your desktop,**right-click** **the speaker icon** at the bottom-right corner, and then select**Sounds** .
