### Fix 1 – Double-check your device and connection

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should do some basic checks to make sure your device and connection work fine.

1. **Test your microphone on another computer** to confirm it’s not physically broken.
2. If you’re using a wired headset,**connect it to a different UBS port** , securely and correctly. It’s suggested you use the USB port at the back of the computer as they generally have more power available.
3. If you’re using a wireless headset, re-establish the connection by**unplugging and replugging the UBS wireless receiver** .
4. **Always plug in your headset before you launch Squad** . If it disconnects during the gameplay, try restarting Squad to get it to work.

 If your hardware and connection are both good to go, check out more fixes.

Follow the steps here:

#### Step 1 – Disable unneeded audio devices

1. At the bottom right corner of your desktop, right-click the**speaker icon** and select**Sounds** .

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 Squad mic not working may indicate your audio driver is faulty or outdated. To avoid the compatibility issues with Squad and keep your microphone working with the best performance, you should update your audio driver on a regular basis.

 There are two ways you can do this:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the audio driver manually

 To update the driver manually, you need to go to the PC manufacturer’s website or sound card’s website to search for the most recent audio driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your audio device and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update audio driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

### Fix 5 – Verify the integrity of game files

1. Launch Steam and click the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-4.jpg)

3. Select**Local Files** and then click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-verify-game-files-2.jpg)

 Does your mic-not-working issue gets fixed now? If not, you should consider**uninstalling Squad and restarting from scratch** . If there was something wrong with your previous installation, you need to perform a fresh reinstallation to get your microphone to work again in Squad.
