## Fix 2 – Update your audio driver

 If you’re using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date, the Logitech G533 headset microphone won’t function properly. So you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes the problem. Here are two options you can get the latest and right audio driver in a safe way: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1 – Manually download and install the driver

 Logitech keeps updating drivers for its devices. All you need is go to the **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024844153--Downloads-G533-Wireless-Gaming-Headset)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically update the driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your audio driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-1-3.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged _Logitech G533 driver_ to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

5. Go to **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024844153--Downloads-G533-Wireless-Gaming-Headset)**  . Then find the latest version of Logitech Gaming Software that is suitable for your operating system and click**Download Now** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-5-1.jpg)
6. Once you finish downloading, double-click the downloaded file and follow the wizard to install the software.

 Now reconnect the Logitech G533 headset to your PC and the microphone should transmit your voice normally.

## Fix 4 – Allow access to your headset microphone (for Windows 10 users)

 You need to allow your Windows 10 system and application to access the headset microphone before you can use it as intended. Here is how to check and modify these settings:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to enter the Windows settings menu.
2. Click**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-1-7.jpg)
3. Click**Microphone** on the left pane. Then, click the**Change** button, and make sure Microphone access for this device is**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-2-6.jpg)
4. Make sure**Allow apps to access your microphone** is turned**on** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-3-4.jpg)

 After finishing the steps above, check if your mic-not-working issue is resolved. If unfortunately, none of the preceding fixes does the trick, chances are that the microphone is physically broken and you may consider contacting the vendor for further assistance.
