### Fix 2: Break the electrical ground loop

 One of the possible causes for buzzing sound is the electrical ground loop, so you should break the loop to fix the problem.

You can try to power everything through a single AC socket.

 You can remove the cables connecting the receiver or device powering your speakers, and only connect your speakers to have a try.

### Fix 3: Avoid frequency interference

 It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1) Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.

2) Remove these device close to your speaker.

3) Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electro magnetic pulse, you should keep your speaker far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 This should solve your buzzing sound issue. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The missing or outdated audio driver can cause the speaker making buzzing sound. So you should verify that your audio driver has the latest version and update it if it doesn’t.

 You can manually update your audio driver from the manufacturer website, which requires time and computer skills. If you don’t have tie or computer skills, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
