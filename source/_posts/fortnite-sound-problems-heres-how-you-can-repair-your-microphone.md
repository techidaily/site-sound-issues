### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

Here is how to do it:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

 2) Click the **Recording** tab, then click on **Headset** **Microphone Corsair VOID Wireless Gaming Dongle** and click **Set Default** .
