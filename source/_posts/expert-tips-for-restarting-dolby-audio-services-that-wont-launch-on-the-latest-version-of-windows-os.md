### Fix 5\. Update audio drivers

 If your PC fails to work with certain Bluetooth earbuds such as Tozo T6, you can try updating the onboard sound card drivers and Bluetooth drivers, which are essentially important to make sure your headphone work with your PC.

There are two ways for you to update an audio driver:

**Option 1 – Manually –**  The manual process requires you to visit the manufacturer’s website to download the latest driver and install them manually, which is time-consuming, technical, and risky. We don’t recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

**Option 2 – Automatically –** Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
