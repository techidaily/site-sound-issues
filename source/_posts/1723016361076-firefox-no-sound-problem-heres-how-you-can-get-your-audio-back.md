 Sometimes sound on your laptop can be accidentally muted. In these circumstances, you’ll no doubt come across the no sound issue from your laptop. Therefore, be sure not to mute the sound.

### Fix 2: Check headphones or speakers work properly

 If the sound problem occurs when headphones or speakers are plugged in to your laptop, make sure your headphones or speakers are working properly.

 You can try to plug your headphones or speakers to another laptop, and see if it works properly. If they are not working at all, then it looks like a hardware problem on your headphones or speakers, and you should head to the manufacturer; if they work perfectly when plugging on another laptop, then the problem lies in your Toshiba laptop, and you can move to the next solution.

### Fix 3: Make sure your audio device is enabled

 If your audio device has been disabled in Windows, anything related to the sound won’t work at all. So you should check and make sure the audio device in your Toshiba laptop is enabled.

Here are the instructions:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

 3) Double click**Sound, video and game controllers** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-743.png)

 4) Right click on your**audio device** (in my case it’s AMD High Definition Audio Device), and click**Enable device** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-745.png)

 If you see**Disable device** in the right-click context menu, it means that your audio device is enabled already. Then you can click**Disable device** then**Enable device** to re-enable it.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 An audio driver problem can result in your sound not working. For instance, if your audio driver is missing or corrupted, your laptop won’t play any sound at all. To rule it out as the cause, you can update your audio driver to the latest version.

 You can update your audio driver by navigating to the manufacturer website of your device, then download and install the latest driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
