### Fix 3: Avoid frequency interference

 It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1) Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.

2) Remove these device close to your speaker.

3) Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electro magnetic pulse, you should keep your speaker far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 This should solve your buzzing sound issue. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver
