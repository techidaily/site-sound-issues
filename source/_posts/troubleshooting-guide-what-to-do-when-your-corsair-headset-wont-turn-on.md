### Fix 4: Make sure your microphone is on for Fortnite

 If you downloaded Fortnite from**the Microsoft Store** , check if it has permission to use your microphone. Here’s how to do it:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap427.jpg)

3\. Run Fortnite to see if chat works now. If not, try Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 Windows and Fortnite both have audio settings, and sometimes things just get a little mixed up. So it can help to reset everything, manually, to clear out the cobwebs. (Kinda like how restarting your PC can sometimes mysteriously resolve problems.) Here is how to do it:

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap925.png)

 ii. Click**the speaker icon** to view the audio settings. Then**turn off Voice Chat** and click**Apply** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap431-1024x576.jpg)

iii. Exit Fortnite.

 2\. On your desktop,**right-click** **the speaker icon** at the bottom-right corner, and then select**Sounds** .
