## Fixes to try

 Here are 5 fixes that helped other users with the Logitech G Pro mic not working issue. You may not try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-25.png)
2. Make sure**Microphone access** and**Logitech G Pro X** are both set to**On** .

**On Windows 10:**

1. In the search box, type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .
