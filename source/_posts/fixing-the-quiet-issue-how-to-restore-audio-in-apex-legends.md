## Conexant HD Audio Not Working in Windows 11? Here's How to Restore Sound

After upgrading system to Windows 10 or performing a Windows 10 update, if you encounter no sound issue with Conexant SmartAudio HD, you can try solutions below  
to fix the problem.
  
**Solution 1: Update the Conexant SmartAudio HD Driver**
  
The problem most probably is caused by driver issues. Windows upgrade or update may remove the driver or may cause the driver to be incompatible. So updating the Conexant SmartAudio HD driver mostly would get the sound back.  
  
Usually, you can download drivers from device manufacturer or PC manufacturer. Conexant does not produce drivers themselves. If you are using a brand computer, go to your PC manufacturer’s website to download the driver. If not, you can go to the motherboard manufacturer’s website to download the driver. Drivers can always be downloaded in Support or Download section of the website.
  
If you have no idea how to update the driver manually, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** to help you.
