 Now that the microphone of your headset is enabled and set as the default device, and you’ve turned up your microphone volume, try it and see if it works. If it does, then you’ve solved the problem. If not, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Update your audio drivers

 The outdated or corrupted audio driver would also cause the headset mic not to work. Many users find that re-installing/updating audio drivers makes their headset mic work again.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical, and error-prone, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to your sound device or your headset to download the latest and correct driver for it.
