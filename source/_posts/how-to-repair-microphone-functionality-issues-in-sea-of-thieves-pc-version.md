## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you can do some troubleshooting via the steps below.

* **Test your Corsair on the other computer** to make sure it’s not physicially broken.
* Repair the connection. Simply**replug the Corsair headset** into your PC and**try another USB port** .  

 If you’re using the wireless dongle, use a paper clip to**press into the tiny hole** near the dongle’s LED. When it starts to blink, hold the**Power button** on your headset until the dongle’s LED turns solid.

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Corsair headset will be set as default automatically once it’s connected properly. But if you’ve constantly changed between the headsets and speakers, the settings might be messed up. And you’ll need to configure the correct setup manually.

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .
