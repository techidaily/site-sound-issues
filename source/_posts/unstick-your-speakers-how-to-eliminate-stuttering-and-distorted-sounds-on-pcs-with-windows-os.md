### Method 4: Update your audio driver

 One reason for the no sound problem is outdated drivers for your hardware devices. If Method 1 and Method 2 can’t fix it, it may be the outdated driver that causes the problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** – You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/driver.jpg)
3. Click the **Update button** next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
