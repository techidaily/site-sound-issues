### 1\. Make sure you use the right ports

 You can connect your Virtuoso headset using the Slipstream Wireless dongle, a 3.5mm jack, or a USB connection. No matter what wired connection you use, you should first make sure you’re utilizing the correct port.

 Then, ensure the detachable microphone is firmly plugged in and check if the RGB LED ring indicates the live status (green).

### 2\. Set Virtuoso as the default recording device

 Check if your Virtuoso is disabled or not set as the default recording device. If so, you may need to check the microphone levels in case the volume is so low that it can’t record your sound clearly.

1. In the notification area, right-click the volume icon and select**Sounds** .

 Now you can test your microphone by recording your own voice using some voice apps such as Voice Recorder. If the Virtuoso mic works now, you can just join a league and enjoy talking with your teammates. But if the Corsaire mic is still not working, you can try the next fix below.

### 3\. Re-installing drivers

 If your Virtuoso microphone not working issue persists, the problem might be in the drivers. Many users find re-installing/updating audio drivers makes their Virtuoso work again.

There are mainly two ways for you to do this:

 Option 1 –**Manually –** You can open the**Device Manage** r and expand the**Audio inputs and outputs** category. Then, right-click the connected headset (i.e. your Corsair Virtuoso) and select**Uninstall device** . Reboot the PC and connect your headset again to let Windows reinstall them. We only recommend this method if you’re confident in playing with device drivers.

 Option 2 –**Automatically –** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** .
