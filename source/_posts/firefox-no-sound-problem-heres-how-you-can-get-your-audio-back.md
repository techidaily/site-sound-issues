### Fix 2: Check your sound settings

 You are likely to run into this issue when Firefox is muted on your computer. To see if that’s the problem for you, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Open Firefox.

**2)** Right-click the**Speakers icon** on the taskbar, and then click**Open Volume mixer** .

**3)** Make sure none of the volume control is muted, or at the bottom.

 If any of the volume controls are muted, you’ll see a red circle with a line through it next to the volume control. In this case, click the**Speakers icon** to unmute.

**4)** Check if the sound comes back now.

 If this didn’t solve your problem, continue to the next solution, below.

### Fix 3: Check Firefox output device

 If you’re using a new audio device, chances are that Windows didn’t switch Firefox to your new device. To fix it, manually change the Firefox output device to default. Here is how:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** key. Then type**app volume** and click**Sound mixer options** .

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of browser audio issues is an outdated or faulty audio driver.

 You can update your device drivers manually, if you’re happy to do them one at a time. But this takes quite a while. Or you can update them all with just a couple of clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-27_12-12-16.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-27_12-12-27.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**4)** Reopen Firefox to test your issue.

 If the audio is still not working, then move on and try the next fix below.
