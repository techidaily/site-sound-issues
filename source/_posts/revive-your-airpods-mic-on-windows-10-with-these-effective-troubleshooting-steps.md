### Fix 2: Update your Bluetooth Drivers

 Normally, if your AirPods microphone isn’t working properly, it’s probably using a broken or outdated Bluetooth driver. Then, updating your Bluetooth driver would fix this problem.

There’re 2 ways to update drivers, manually and automatically.

#### Option 1 – Install the latest Bluetooth driver manually

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.  
 Then, type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .

2. Click **Bluetooth** to expand the category. Right-click your Bluetooth adapter and select **Update driver** .

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.
5. Restart your PC and check your AirPods mic.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 After updating your Bluetooth driver, reboot your PC to check if you can use AirPods microphone on Windows.

### Fix 3: Install Windows updates

 Microsoft releases Windows 10 updates to fix certain issues and offer new features. Many times, users find their problems were solved after running Microsoft Windows updates, and there’re users have reported the mic started working after updating Windows 10 to the latest build.

So follow the steps below to install the latest Windows updates.

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time on your keyboard to open Windows Settings. Then, click **Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. In the Windows Update panel, click **Check for updates** . Windows will check and download the latest available patches automatically.

 If you see “You’re up to date” after clicking the button, your PC confirms that it has all Windows updates.

3. Restart your PC and check the AirPods microphone after the whole process is finished.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, the next one might suit you.

### Fix 4: Use a Bluetooth adapter

 In some cases, the built-in Bluetooth adapter cannot handle AirPods, so your AirPods microphone can’t work properly. The solution is to use a new Bluetooth adapter.

 If your AirPods are working well on iPhone and there’s nothing you can do to your PC, give the new Bluetooth adapter a go.

 Here I suggest you to borrow from your family member or friend, if it’s working, then you can consider buying a new Bluetooth adapter.

 AirPods are great, hope this post would help you fix the AirPods mic not working issue. But if nothing works for you, maybe turn to other hands-free headsets would be a good idea.
