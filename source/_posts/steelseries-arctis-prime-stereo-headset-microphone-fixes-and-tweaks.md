### **Fix 2: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

 Having **Exclusive Mode**   on means the specific app will take full control while in use so that other apps cannot play audio through the device. But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the **crackling or popping sound** in headphone  problem. To disable **Exclusive Mode** :

 1) On the bottom right of your screen, right-click on**the sound icon** , then click**Sounds** .
