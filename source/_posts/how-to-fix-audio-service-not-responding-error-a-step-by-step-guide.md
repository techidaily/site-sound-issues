## Before we move further…

 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

1. Disconnect your Jabra headset from other devices (like your mobile phone) and leave your computer only to see if it works properly.
2. Restart your computer and your Jabra headset, then try the connection again.
3. Make sure that your Jabra headset is fully charged.
4. Make sure that your computer and Jabra headset are still in Bluetooth range and connected.
5. Try to reset your Jabra headset to its default status, then try the connection again.

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your computer is corrupted, faulty or outdated, a headset may not connect to the PC or work correctly. You may find the mic is malfunctioning or there’s no sound at all. In this case, you should run a scan and**install the latest correct audio driver** .

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 If the audio-not-working issue only occurs in a few specific programs, make sure you’ve **set your Jabra headset as the default device in the app settings** . Now see if the audio works. If not, take a look at more fixes below.

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer. The reset button varies on different Jabra headsets, but normally you could**hold the multi-function button for around 10 seconds** to clear the settings.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-1.jpg)
2. If you see your Jabra headphone is listed under Audio, click it and click**Remove device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-3.jpg)
3. Turn off your Bluetooth for a few seconds and toggle it on.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-4.jpg)
4. Click**Add Bluetooth or device** .

Does your Jabra headset work now? If not, try the next method.

## Fix 4 – Check for damaged system files

 The Jabra headset not working issue may indicate deeper system damages. So you should run a scan to check for any missing and corrupted system files. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a powerful Windows solution that can scan, diagnose, and repair damaged system files while keeping your settings and data.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-1.jpg)
3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**START REPAIR** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

If restoring your computer still failed, there is the last method to try.

## Fix 5 – Update the firmware

 If neither of these methods helps, consider updating the firmware. Whether you’re using a corded or Bluetooth headphone, the firmware update can help you improve the device performance and prevent potential bugs.

1. Download **[Jabra Direct](https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/jabra-direct)**  and launch the app.
2. Connect your Jabra headset to the computer and it should be automatically detected by the program.
3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/firmware-update-1.jpg)
4. Select the language you prefer and click**Update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/firmware-update-2.jpg)
5. Click**Ok** when the update completes.
