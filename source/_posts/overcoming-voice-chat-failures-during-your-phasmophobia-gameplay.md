## Fix 1: Check sound settings

 Sometimes your Microphone may not be detected or selected correctly. So when you’re in-game, the voice chat would not be working as you wish. To fix it, you should check your sound settings.

 1) In your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select**Open Sound settings.**

![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/open-sound-settings.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) Make sure that your input device is set to whatever microphone you’re currently using or prefer to use. Then click**Device properties** .

![check input device ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/check-your-input-device-1200x903.jpg)

3) Set the volume to at least 50.

 After applying the changes, play your game to check if the problem persists.

## Fix 2: Check in-game audio settings

 The in-game audio settings set by default would probably not be able to ensure everything’s going right. So you need to check them by following the steps below.

 1) Launch your game and click**Option** .

![check in-game audio settings Phasmophobia voice chat not working](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-options-1200x722.jpg)

 2) Make sure your Microphone has been set correctly. Then click**Test** to test the voice recognition.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Remember to click**Apply** if you change the**Microphone** .

 3) You’ll be asked to speak into your connected piece of hardware to ensure Voice Recognition is properly set up. If it shows**We heard you!** , your voice chat should be working now.

## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 This voice chat not working issue may indicate that**the audio driver you’re using is out of date** . If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [**automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your audio driver

 To update drivers manually, you can go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the audio card’s website to check for the latest audio driver. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended to go to the PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model or the device model and the specific operating system that you are using.

### Option 2: Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It’s a useful tool that will help detect any outdated drivers, then download and install the latest drivers for your system. With Driver Easy, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
  
 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.

![update audio driver automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/click-update-all.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 1) In the Search box, type**network reset** . Then click**Network reset** from the results.

## Fix 5: Verify the integrity of game files

 Verifying the integrity of game files is a recommended troubleshooting step you should take when you’re faced with some bugs. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files is intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or corrupted files. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) Launch Steam client. From the **LIBRARY**  section, right-click on **Phasmophobia** and select **Properties**  from the menu.

![verify integrity of game files Phasmophobia voice chat not working](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-on-Properties-1.png)

 2) Select the **Installed Files**  tab and click the **Verify integrity of game files** button.

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-1200x610.jpg)

 3) Steam will verify the game’s files and this process may take several minutes. After it’s finished, launch your game to check if it works for you.
