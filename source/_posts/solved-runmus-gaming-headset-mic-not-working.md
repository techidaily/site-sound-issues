## 1\. Set your microphone as the default device

 Oftentimes, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But you may have multiple input or recording devices connected. It would occur to you that your computer is using another device instead of the one you’re attempting to use. In order to set your Redragon microphone as your input device, follow the instructions below:

 1) At the bottom-right corner of your taskbar, right-click your speaker icon and select **Open Sound settings** .  
  
![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-sound-settings-1.png)

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) When the Sound window opens, select the **Recording**  tab. Click on your microphone and then click **Set Default > OK** .

If that didn’t help, proceed to the next fix.

## 2\. Turn on app permissions for your microphone

 Normally, when your headset is plugged in, your system will detect it and your apps can access the microphone. But for some reasons, it may fail to do that. To check if your apps have access to your microphone, follow these steps:

 1) Press the **Windows + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.

 2) Click **Privacy** .
