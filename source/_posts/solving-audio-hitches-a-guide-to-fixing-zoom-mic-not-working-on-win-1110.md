### Fix 3 – Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of Zoom microphone not working is an outdated or a faulty audio driver. To keep your audio devices work in the tip-top condition, you should install the latest audio driver.

There are two ways you can update your audio driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your audio device or motherboard, and search for the most recent driver. After you download the correct driver that’s compatible with your Windows version, follow the on-screen instructions to install it manully.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
