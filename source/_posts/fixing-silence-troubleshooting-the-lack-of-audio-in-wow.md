## Troubleshooting Guide: Fixing Windows 10 Audio Issues - Solved

If your external speakers are not working on Windows 10, don’t worry, you’re not alone. The speakers not working problem could relate to many factors, for instance, the speakers, the hardware themselves, could be damaged, your system sound could be muted, your audio driver could be faulty, and so forth. If you encounter this problem, follow the troubleshooting tips here and find the solution that works for you.

## Step 1, make sure your speakers are not the problem

 Try to test your speakers on another device (a computer or a mobile phone would both do) to see if they are working properly. This will help determine if the issue is with the speakers themselves or with your computer.

 When the above check is done, and you find the problem on your computer, please move on.

## Step 2, make sure the connection between your speakers and computer is good

 If the speakers work properly on a second device, make sure that the connection between your speakers and your computer is intact.

 For instance, if you’re using Bluetooth speakers, make sure the Bluetooth connection is working well, which can be proved by a second Bluetooth device connected to your computer.

 If you’re using a wired connection, make sure the cables are plugged into the correct ports. This is because many computers have three or more jacks that connect to a sound card or sound processor, including a microphone jack, line-in jack, and line-out jack.

 And your speakers should be plugged into the line-out jack. If you’re not sure which jack this is, try plugging your speakers or headphones into each of the jacks to see if any of them produce sound.

## Step 3, check the volume settings

 If your speakers are muted or their volume is set to too slow, the speakers would produce no sound. You can follow the steps below to check and ensure the volume is set correctly.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** key at the same time to invoke the run box.
2. Type control panel and click**OK** . This is to open Control Panel window.
