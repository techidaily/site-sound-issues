## Hearthstone Quieted Down? Here's How to Turn Up the Volume Again

If you’re playing_Hearthstone_ and the audio cuts out abruptly, or there is no sound at all, you’re not alone! Many players are reporting it. But the good news is that you can fix it. Here are 7 fixes to try.

## 7 simple fixes to try

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way through the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

1. **[Check cables and volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[End unnecessary background programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Repair_Hearthstone_ files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable Compatibility Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reset sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Reinstall_Hearthstone_ and/or the Blizzard launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check cables and volume

 If you don’t have any sound at all, you need to check your audio device is well-connected to your computer, and it’s not muted. Follow the instructions below:

* Check your speaker and headphone connections for loose cables or the wrong jack.
* Check your power and volume levels, and try turning all the volume controls up.
* Some speakers and apps have their own volume controls, and you might have to check them all.
* Remember that your speakers probably won’t work when headphones are plugged in.

If your cables and volume are okay, move on and check the fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common issues of the_Hearthstone_ audio issue is a corrupted or outdated audio driver. To keep the audio works properly on your computer, it’s essential that you have the latest correct audio driver at all times.

There are two ways you can update your audio driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/hearthstone-no-sound-issue/#e2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your sound card keeps updating the audio driver. To get it, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your driver automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-281.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 3: End unnecessary background programs
