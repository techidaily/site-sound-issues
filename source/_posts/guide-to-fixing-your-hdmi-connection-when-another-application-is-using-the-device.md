 If you can’t hear sound via HDMI output, and you get error message saying “The device is being used by another application……”, don’t worry. You can get the sound back by following the instructions below. The steps apply to Windows 10, 7 & 8.

 The issue probably is caused by corrupted hdmi audio driver installed on your computer. So to fix the issue, you can try rolling back the hdmi audio driver or updating the hdmi audio driver.

## **Roll Back the HDMI Audio Driver to Previous Version**

 Many people like AMD, Intel Graphics card users have reported this method helped resolve their ‘The device is being used by another application’ error . So it’s worth a try.

To roll back the driver, follow these steps:

 1\. Go to[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 2\. Expand the category “Sound, video and game controllers” and right-click on the audio device and select**Properties** . You may notice there are more than one audio device under this category. Choose the right HDMI output device according to the graphics card that you are using (HDMI output is usually on the graphics card).

 3\. Go to the**Driver** tab and click the**Roll Back Driver** button. Note you will need to provide administrator permission to perform this. Mare sure you have signed in to Windows with an administrator account. (If the Roll Back Driver button is grey out, it means this method doesn’t work for you. You can try the next method.)
