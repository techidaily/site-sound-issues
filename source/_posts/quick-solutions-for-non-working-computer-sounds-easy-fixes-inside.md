 Outdated or incompatible audio drivers can cause audio issues. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now. Driver updates often tackle bugs, enhance compatibility, and improve performance.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Get driver updates from the manufacturer’s websites or via the Device Manager

 You can visit the manufacturer’s website for your sound card, find the driver version that corresponds with your system, and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the latest driver.

_Have no idea which sound card you have? Take these steps:_

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and hit Enter.

 Then follow the on-screen instructions to search for and install the latest drivers.

### Option 2: Automatically update drivers with Driver Easy

 If you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy is a driver updater tool designed to simplify the process of updating device drivers. It is user-friendly and convenient. You don’t need to know the make and model of your audio device, Driver Easy handles it all. Driver Easy can help you identify missing and outdated drivers, and download and install the latest ones for your system, direct from the manufacturer’s websites.

Below is the simple three-step guide to update drivers with Driver Easy:

1. **Download** and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
