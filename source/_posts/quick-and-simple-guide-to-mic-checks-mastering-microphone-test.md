### Bonus tip: How to fix microphone not working on your computer?

 Don’t worry if your microphone is not working on your computer. One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty sound card driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your sound card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your computer, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact sound card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. Download and install[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 Alternatively if you’re comfortable manually installing drivers, you can click**Update** next to each flagged device in the free version to automatically download the correct driver. Once it’s downloaded, you can manually install it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2019-09-20_11-49-09.png)
