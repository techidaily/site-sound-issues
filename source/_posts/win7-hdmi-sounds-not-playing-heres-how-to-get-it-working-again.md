## Win7 HDMI Sounds Not Playing? Here's How to Get It Working Again

If you can’t get sound to play through HDMI in Windows 7, you can try solutions in this post. After that, the sound should come back.  
  
**Solution 1: Test all hardware devices**
  
The problem would be caused by broken hardware devices. Test the related hardware devices in following order.  
  
1\. **Test if the cable works properly**. Use another cable to connect the display monitor to your PC.
  
2.**Test if the output port has problem**. If your PC has more than one HDMI output ports, plug the cable to another port and see if the problem persists.  
  
3.**Test if the monitor works fine**. Check and make sure the  monitor’s speaker volume is not turned down or muted. If no problem is found there, connect the monitor to another PC.  
  
**Solution 2: Update Audio Drivers**
  
 The audio would not work if there is problem with the sound drivers or the display audio drivers. So you can try updating the drivers to resolve the problem. You can go to your PC’s manufacturer’s website to download the latest drivers.
