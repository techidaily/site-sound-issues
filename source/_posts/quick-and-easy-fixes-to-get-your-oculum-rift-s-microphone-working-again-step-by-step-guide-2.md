![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/RECON-70-SILVER_HEADSET_1.jpg)

 Turtle Beach Recon 70 is a solid choice with decent sound quality for those looking for an affordable gaming headset. Although users have been reporting problems with its microphone every now and then, most of them can be easily fixed. If you’re**using Turtle Beach Recon 70 on PC** and find**its mic not working** , follow this guide to get it back to work!

### First, you need to make sure…

##### 1: If the headset itself can function normally

 Pair your headset to your phone or tablet to see if the microphone works. If it works, then skip to check your PC audio port below.

 If it doesn’t work with other devices, you may want to contact Turtle Beach support as there might be something wrong with the headset itself.

##### **2: Your PC has a single audio jack**

 If your PC has a single audio jack, then plugging in the headset cable should connect your Turtle Beach Recon 70 to your PC correctly.

 If your PC has two jacks to separate input and output for headphone audio and mic audio, you would need a[mic splitter](https://www.amazon.com/Headphone-Splitter-KOOPAO-Microphone-Earphones/dp/B084V3TRTV/?tag=drivereasycom-20) to use this headset with your PC.

### Try these fixes…

**[1: Enable your headset mic for recording](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 3:**Update your audio driver**

 An outdated or faulty driver can cause a lot of problems. When your mic is down, you may want to update your audio driver to make sure it’s functioning properly.

 There are two ways you can get the right audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Notice that although Windows can scan for available updates for your driver automatically, it doesn’t update its database very often. It’s possible that you need a new version of the driver but Device Manager won’t detect any.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the most recent driver for your exact audio card as well as your Windows version. Then it will download and install the driver correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_17-54-35.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_17-54-43.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new driver to take effect. Check if your headset microphone works now. If it still won’t pick up your voice, move on to the next solution.

### Fix 4:**Turn on microphone access on your PC**

 Although less likely, it’s possible that the microphone access on your PC has been disabled so your headset mic can’t record any voice. To turn on the microphone access on your computer:

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**microphone** then click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_18-08-05.jpg)
2. Click**Change** , then**turn on the microphone access** **for this device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_18-10-26.jpg)

 Check if your headset mic is working. If this doesn’t give you luck, try the last solution below.

### Fix 5:**Re-enable your headset mic via Device Manager**

 Even if you connect the headset to your PC correctly, sometimes your system just won’t recognize the device. You can manually disable then re-enable your headset in Device Manager to see if it helps:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** , then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_18-30-17.jpg)
3. Under**Audio inputs and outputs** , right-click your headset then select**Disable Device** .

Check if your headset mic works.

 If none of the above solutions seem to help in your case, you could take a look at the audio settings of the program or game in which you need the mic. Sometimes you need to manually enable your mic to record within the program.  
  
 Also, you could try to turn off chat apps such as Skype and Discord as they may interfere with your mic functionality.
