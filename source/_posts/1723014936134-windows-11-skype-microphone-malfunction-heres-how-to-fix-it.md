### Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If you’re using a faulty, corrupted or outdated audio driver, various audio issues will occur. You may find the microphone is malfunctioning or there’s no sound when using Google Meet. To fix the issue, make sure you install the latest correct audio driver.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct audio drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

 Test your microphone again to see if it works without problem. If the issue persists, check out the next solution below.

### Fix 4 – Check Google Meet’s settings

 Normally, your browser and Google Meet will use the microphone you set as default on your computer, but in case something messed up, you can manually check if Google Meet is identifying and accessing the correct audio device.

1. Enter your online meeting on Google Meet. Click the**lock icon** at the far right of the Google chrome search bar, and**toggle on the permission to your microphone** .

2. Make sure your microphone is not turned off.
3. Click the**vertical ellipsis icon** at the top left and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting-2.jpg)
4. From the drop-down menu under Microphone, select your primary microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting-3.jpg)

 If you still can’t use the microphone in Google Meet, the last resort is to**double-check the physical connection** .

 For example, if you’re using a wired headset, make sure it’s securely plugged in and check if your USB ports are functioning well. If you use a Bluetooth headset, try repairing it to your computer and see how things go.
