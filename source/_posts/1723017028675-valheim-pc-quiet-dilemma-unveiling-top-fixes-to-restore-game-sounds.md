## 6 Fixes for Battlefield 4 No Sound Issues

 We know how frustrating it can be when you can’t hear anything in a game. Below you will find fixes to get your audio work again in Battlefield 4\. Before you head to the following fixes, make sure you check the connections of your headset/speakers.

1. **[Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Check your default playback device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check Windows Volume Mixer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Disable Windows Defender](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Verify the game integrity](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Rule out other interference](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1\. Update your audio drivers

 A faulty/outdated audio driver can cause game audio issues. An audio driver is a translator for your system and device, and if it goes wrong, you will be having sound problems. There are onboard sound card drivers and headset drivers (for some older ones).

 To ensure that you have the latest & correct audio driver installed, you can go to**Device Manager** and update all your audio drivers there. However, Windows delivers a relatively new driver (not always the latest driver). Instead, you can use Driver Easy to let it find and update drivers automatically:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scannow.jpg)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct audio driver (You can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install all the latest correct drivers that are missing or outdated (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![update sound card driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/update-audio-driver.jpg)

4) Restart your computer and check whether your problem is solved.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

## Fix 2\. Check your default playback device

 The issue occurs when you set the wrong default output device. It’s possible that other games or apps are working great but Battlefield 4 is acting up.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **mmsys.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/playback-settings.jpg)

 2) Set the right device as the default playback device. There will be a green tick and a signal icon on this device if it’s set as default.

![set the right default device](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/speaker.jpg)

 3) If this device is not the one you desired, you can right-click another device and select**Set as Default Device** .

![set another device as default](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/set-as-default.jpg)

 4) Right-click your default device and select**Properties** . Go to the Advanced tab, and select a format**no more than 24 bit, 96000 Hz** .

![choose a correct sample format](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/quality.jpg)

 5) Click**Apply** to save the changes.

 Now launch your Battlefield 4 to check if the sound is coming back. If unfortunately not, don’t worry since we have a few more fixes for you to try.

 2) Under**Microsoft Defender Firewall** , swap it to**Off** .

![toggle firewall to off](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firewall-off.jpg)

Launch your Battlefield 4 and check if the sound is working now.

## Fix 5\. Verify the game integrity

 In case that some essential files are missing, it’s recommended to verify your game files (repair game) before you head to other fixes.

1) Start Origin and login in.

2) Click on**My Game Library** and right-click on the desired game and choose **Repair** .

![Battlefield 4 repair](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/battlefield-1200x686.jpg)

3) Once complete, close Origin. Then run Origin as administrator.

 Play Battlefield 4 and test the sound issue. If the Battlefield 4 sound not working issue persists, it’s very likely caused by interference by your devices or other apps.

## Fix 6\. Rule out other interference

 First, unplug all of your external devices and make sure that no unnecessary devices are connected to your USB ports. Then disable Origin In-Game.

1) Open the Origin client and log into your EA Account.

2) Click the Origin menu and select **Application Settings** .

![origin application settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/app.jpg)

 3) Click the **Origin In-Game** tab. Toggle the **Off** switch to turn Origin In-Game off.

![turn off orgin in game](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/originingame.jpg)

 If disabling Origin In-Game Overlay doesn’t work, you can[perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) on your PC to find a problematic application.
