## Fix 3 – Update your Logitech G933 driver

 The Logitech G933 no sound issue may occur if you’re using the wrong sound card driver or it’s out of date. So you can update your Logitech headset driver to see if that fixes the problem.

 You can search for the latest sound card driver from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  and then install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

You can also click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.)
