#### 1\. Turn the volume control up and down

 while connected, turn the volume up and down to test if the sound works properly.

### Fix 3: Avoid frequency interference

 It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1) Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.

2) Remove these device close to your speaker.

3) Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electro magnetic pulse, you should keep your speaker far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 This should solve your buzzing sound issue. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The missing or outdated audio driver can cause the speaker making buzzing sound. So you should verify that your audio driver has the latest version and update it if it doesn’t.
