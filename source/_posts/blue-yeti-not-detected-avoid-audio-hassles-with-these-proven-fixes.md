Blue Yeti is an excellent microphone for beginners. However, many users may experience the ‘Blue Yeti not recognized’ issue. This can be quite easy to troubleshoot and in this post, you will learn every possible fix to get your microphone working.

2. **[Update the microphone driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Show disabled devices in settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1\. Try another USB port/cable

 First, to rule out a hardware issue, you can try another USB port and make sure your USB cable is properly connected. Check whether your microphone goes back to work. Many users find it works when they switch the USB port from 3.0 to 2.0.
