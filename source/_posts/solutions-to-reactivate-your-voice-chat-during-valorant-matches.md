### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 Windows and Fortnite both have audio settings, and sometimes things just get a little mixed up. So it can help to reset everything, manually, to clear out the cobwebs. (Kinda like how restarting your PC can sometimes mysteriously resolve problems.) Here is how to do it:

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap925.png)

 ii. Click**the speaker icon** to view the audio settings. Then**turn off Voice Chat** and click**Apply** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap431-1024x576.jpg)

iii. Exit Fortnite.

 2\. On your desktop,**right-click** **the speaker icon** at the bottom-right corner, and then select**Sounds** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap432.jpg)

 3\. Click the **Playback** tab, select the speakers/headphones you’re using and click **Set Default** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 4\. Click the **Recording** tab, select the microphone you’re using and click **Set Default** .

 5\. While still in the**Recording** tab, try**speaking into your microphone** to test if it works properly. If it is, you should see some green in the bar on the right:
