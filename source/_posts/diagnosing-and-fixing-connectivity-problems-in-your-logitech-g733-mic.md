## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Whenever you’re troubleshooting a headset with no sound, first verify it’s not a hardware issue. Here is how to do a quick check:

* First,**plug your Logitech G933 headset into another audio jack** to inspect the port.
* **Connect your headset to another machine** to test if the device is intact. If it doesn’t play any sound neither, chances are that your headset is damaged, and you’d better contact Logitech for repair or replacement.

 If your hardware works fine, the problem may be related to the sound settings, the audio driver or even the Logitech software you’ve installed. Keep reading for more corresponding solutions.

## Fix 3 – Update your Logitech G933 driver

 The Logitech G933 no sound issue may occur if you’re using the wrong sound card driver or it’s out of date. So you can update your Logitech headset driver to see if that fixes the problem.

 You can search for the latest sound card driver from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  and then install it manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** . You can also click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.)
