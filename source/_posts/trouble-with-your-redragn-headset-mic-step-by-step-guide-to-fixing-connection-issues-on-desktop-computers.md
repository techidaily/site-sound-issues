## Trouble with Your Blue Yeti? Here Are Solutions to Get It Recognized Again

Blue Yeti is an excellent microphone for beginners. However, many users may experience the ‘Blue Yeti not recognized’ issue. This can be quite easy to troubleshoot and in this post, you will learn every possible fix to get your microphone working.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just walk your way down until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Try another USB port/cable](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update the microphone driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Show disabled devices in settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Use the audio troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1\. Try another USB port/cable

 First, to rule out a hardware issue, you can try another USB port and make sure your USB cable is properly connected. Check whether your microphone goes back to work. Many users find it works when they switch the USB port from 3.0 to 2.0.

 If Blue Yeti is still not showing up on your PC, you can try another USB cable. You can easily get a[**replacement cable**](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Snowball-Product-Picture-Compatibility/dp/B08JG1SNB7?tag=drivereasycom-20) at Amazon. Check that the status light is illuminated.

### Fix 2\. Update the microphone driver

 If there’s nothing wrong with your hardware, the culprit might be your software. When the related driver software gets corrupted or outdated, your Blue Yeti microphone won’t be recognized.

There are mainly two methods for you to fix this driver issue:

#### Option 1 –**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you’re not confident playing with device drivers, you can update the driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your sound card and Blue Yeti microphone, and it will download and install them correctly.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update** next to the flagged driver (this is partially manual).
