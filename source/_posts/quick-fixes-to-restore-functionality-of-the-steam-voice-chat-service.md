### Fix 3: Install the latest Fortnite patch

 If you run**Fortnite** from the **Epic Games Launcher** , you can follow the instructions below to check for the latest Fortnite patch:

1\. Run the Epic Games Launcher.

 2\. On the left panel, click **Library** . On the right, click **the gear button** on the lower-right corner of **Fortnite** .

### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.
