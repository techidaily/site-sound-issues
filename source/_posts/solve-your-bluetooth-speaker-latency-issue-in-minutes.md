 4) Restart your computer, play some music and see if **Bluetooth Connected But No Sound**  problem has been resolved.

### Fix 5: Repair corrupted system files

 If you are facing persistent issues and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it is possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended.[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

2. Open Fortect and run a free scan of your PC. Wait a few minutes, and it will give you a detailed report of your PC status.
3. If Fortectdetects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fortectstartrepair.png)

 The repair is available with the paid version of Fortect which comes with a full money-back guarantee and full technical support. If you need any assistance, feel free to contact their support team.

Once finished with the repair, check if the error has been resolved.
