### Fix 2: Check the hardware problem

Your hardware issues can cause your sound not working on PC.

#### 1\. Check the speaker on your computer

 Simply take a look at the speaker on your computer and see whether there is anything covering upon the speaker, which could cause no sound on your computer. Make sure there is no dust or cloth that can cover the sound on your computer.

#### 2\. Check the headphone jack

 You should check the headphone jack if you’re connecting headphone to your PC. Look inside the headphone jack see if there is any obstacle that may stop the headphone from working properly.

 If there is, clean the jacks with a cotton swab or soft brush. Push it into the jack and swirl it around a little bit to get the dust and lint out.

#### 3\. Check your headset

 If your PC is connecting to your headphone, you should also take a look at your headphone to make sure that the devices are working normally.

 You can disconnect your headphone, then see there is any sound from your PC. If yes, it seems to be an issue with your headset, so you can replace with a headphone that works.

 If your sound is still not working, it should be a problem with your PC. Continue with the methods below.

### Fix 3: Run Hardware and Sound troubleshooter

 The Hardware and Sound troubleshooter scans your PC and provides solutions for detected issues. So you can run the troubleshooter and see if it helps with your sound problem.

Here’s what you can do:

### Fix 4: Update your sound card driver

 If your sound card driver is missing or outdated, you’ll have the sound problems on PC, so you should update your sound card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your audio card manufacturer, find the latest correct driver for your sound card, then download and install it manually into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers in your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff38bc0d8a.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it in your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All and get a**30-day money back guarantee** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff3a386818.jpg)
4. Restart your computer to take effect.

Test and see if PC sound starts working.

 If the sound problem still persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 5: Configure the audio settings in your PC

 Improper audio settings in your computer can also cause your sound not working. So you should check the following audio settings to fix your sound problem.

To do so:

1. Right click the volume icon at the bottom right corner, and click**Playback devices** . (If there is no Playback devices in the right-click context menu, click**Sounds** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdfeff9ac647.png)
2. In the**Playback** tab, right click on any**empty area** and check the box next to**Show Disabled Devices** and**Show Disconnected Devices** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff0531a8bf.jpg)
3. Select your**audio device** and click**Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff073c7190.jpg)  
Ensure there’s a green check next to your audio device.
4. Click**Apply** and**OK** to save the changes.

Test and see if there is any sound from your speaker.

If it works now, then your problem should have been resolved.

If not, continue these steps:

1. On the same**Playback** pane, select your audio device and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bdff0a2d3420.jpg)
2. Click the**Advanced** tab. In the**Default Format** section, choose different**audio rate** and click**Test** to see if there’s sound.

Try different audio format until you find the one that works.

Still no luck? Okay, there’s one more thing to try.
