 The first thing you need to try is to make sure the headset’s volume wheel is set to a reasonable value.

2. Place A50 headset on the Base Station, and make sure it’s seated correctly.
3. Once synced together, you will see the LED lights on the front of the Base Station will starting Blinking.
4. Make sure the optical cable is fully plugged into the “**MICRO USB** ” and the other end of the cable is plugged firmly into the USB port of your PC.
