 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-sound-settings.png)

 3) Make sure the box next to**Disable** is unchecked.  
  
![make sure your device isn't disabled](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/make-sure-your-headset-isnt-disabled.png)

 After you’ve confirmed that the microphone is enabled, try to speak something to see if it’s now back to the normal state. If the microphone is still not working, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Set your device as default

 When you’re using an external camera, you might need to set that device as the audio device in order to access the built-in microphone. Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But sometimes it just fails to do that and you have to set it manually:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .

![set your device as the default](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/microphone.png)

 After applying changes, do a mic test to check if this method did the trick. If the microphone is still not working, you need to check the input sensitivity of your mic to ensure it is not too low or too high which could cause issues. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) In the Sound window (shown as the picture above), right-click the microphone and select**Properties** .

 2) Go to the**Levels** tab. Then, drag the slider to adjust the volume. While performing this step, you need to do a mic test at the same time.
