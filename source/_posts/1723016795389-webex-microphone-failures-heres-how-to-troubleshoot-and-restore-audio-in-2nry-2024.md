## Fix 1 – Allow access to your microphone on your PC

 If your Corsair HS35 is not activated in the Window settings, your PC will lack the access to your microphone and so the mic just won’t start to work at all. Follow these steps to allow access to your microphone:

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings, then select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/setting-Privacy.jpg)
2. Select**Microphone** on the left panel, then click the**Change** button to see if the toggle is**On** in the pop-up menu. If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mic-setting-1.jpg)
3. Check to see if the toggle in the**Allow apps to access your microphone** section is turned**On** . If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.

 You can manually install the most recent driver from your PC manufacturer’s official website or from the **[Corsair download page](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads)**  .

You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DE-audio-card-driver.jpg)

## Fix 5 – Use a USB audio card

 If your computer’s sound card is defective or if your laptop/desktop system has a faulty 3.5mm audio port, the Corsair HS35 mic may not be able to work properly. If that is the case, you might think about using a USB Audio Card, which is an external sound device that can **bypass problems in your built-in sound card and regain the audio function for you** .
