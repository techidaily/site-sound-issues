 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

## Fix 1: Restart your computer

 This is the quickest fix to try when you’re experiencing Overwatch audio issues. Just restart your computer and Overwatch to test your issue. If your problem still exists, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Run Discord as Administrator

 If you’re using Discord instead of Overwatch’s own chat feature, try this fix. If you’re not using Discord, move on to **[Fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  below.

 In general, you should run perfectly fine without admin access in most cases. But if your game is running in administrator mode, Discord will not be able to capture push-to-talk keys unless you’re running Discord as administrator, too.

If you’re not sure how to do it, follow the instructions below:

 1) Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

 2) Right-click Discord then select **End Task** . (Ensure you right-click on the main Discord link, not the subdirectory entries)

 3) Right-click the Discord icon on your desktop, then select **Properties** .

 4) Under the **Compatibility**  tab, check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** , then click **OK** .

5) Relaunch Discord.

If your issue persists, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 In most cases, audio issues occur when users are using the faulty audio driver, or the driver is outdated. It’s essential that you have the latest correct audio driver at all times to keep Overwatch running smoothly.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver:

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your sound card keeps updating the driver. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer’s website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)**  Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Fix 4: Install the latest Overwatch patch

 The developers of Overwatch release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your chat from working, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

To check if there is any update, follow the instructions below:

**1)** Run Blizzard Battle.net App.

**2)** Click **Overwatch > Options > Patch Notes** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-712.png)

 If a patch is available, install it, then run your game again to check whether your problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 5: Check your in-game settings

**1)** Run**Overwatch** .

**2)** Go to**Options** .
