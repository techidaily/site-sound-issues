### Solution 1 â€“ Update the sound card driver

 Updating the sound card driver should always be your go-to option when you suspect somethingâ€™s wrong with your sound card.  You can either update the sound card driver manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product to automatically update the driver for you.

#### Option 1 â€“ Use Windows Update to manually update the sound card driver

1. On the Windows desktop, click on the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8386fc8d4b0.png)
2. Open the**Sound, video and game controllers** entry.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8387b285c81.jpg)
3. For each device under the entry,**right-click** on them one by one and select**Update driver** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8388110b553.png)
4. Click on**Search automatically for updated driver software** . Then Windows will search online for the correct driver for your sound card.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83888a27eb0.png)  
 Note: If youâ€™re told that**The best drivers for your device are already installed** , because sometimes Microsoft might not be able to detect the update for some reasons, then you can try option 2 below to let**Driver Easy** automatically update the sound card driver for you.
5. Repeat step 3 and 4 with the other device(s) in the entry.

#### Option 2 â€“ Use Driver Easy to automatically update the sound card driver

 If youâ€™re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Itâ€™s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them â€“ either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 After updating the driver for your sound card, you can restart your computer and test the volume by playing a song. If the problem persists, continue with the troubleshooting steps in the next sections.

### Solution 2 â€“ Reinstall the sound card driver

 If updating the sound card driver doesnâ€™t work, try reinstalling the driver:

1. In**Device Manager** , click on the**Sound, video and game controllers** directory.

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd**
2. From the results, **right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select   **Run as administrator.**

### Solution 6 â€“ **Place your computer in Safe Mode**

 If all the above methods arenâ€™t successful for you, we recommend placing your computer in Safe Mode to see if everything(especially the volume control) functions properly there to verify the cause of the volume control not working problem.

**Safe mode** is a diagnostic mode of a computer operating system, which loads only essential processes and drivers. Itâ€™s sometimes necessary to enter Safe Mode in order to troubleshoot problems on your PC.

 Here are the steps of how to enter Safe Mode with Internet to troubleshoot the problem.

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7b8ac86a6f5.png)**  key  and **R**  key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **msconfig**  and click   **OK.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83ccc168f4b.png)
3. At the top of the **System Configuration**  window, click on the **Boot**  tab, **check**  the box next to **Safe boot** , select **Network**  and click   **OK.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83ccdde7859.jpg)  
**Note:** If you want to start Windows in**Normal Mode** , ensure the**Safe boot** box is**unchecked** .
4. Save any open files and close all programs, and click   **Restart.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83cd006284c.png)
5. Once in Safe Mode, try adjusting the system volume.  
   * If the volume control is working, you can download  an antivirus and run a scan in Safe Mode, then restart your PC normally to see if the problemâ€™s resolved.  
   * If the volume control doesnâ€™t work as expected, you can restart you PC normally and try the last solution below.

### Solution 7 â€“ **Run a task via Task Manager**

If the issue still persists, we suggest you to try the below troubleshooting steps and check:

1. Press **CTRL+Shift+ESC** on the keyboard to access **Task manager** .
2. Click on the **File**  tab and select**Run new task** .
