 If you’ve plugged the external sound device into the computer,_**ensure they are recognized by your computer**_ .  
**How to check** : In the system tray, if you see a red x with circle icon the speaker icon, it indicates the external sound device (for example, your speakers or your microphone) is not connected to the computer.

 Solution 5: Update the audio driver

 You can update the audio driver manually. Just go to your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest audio driver.
