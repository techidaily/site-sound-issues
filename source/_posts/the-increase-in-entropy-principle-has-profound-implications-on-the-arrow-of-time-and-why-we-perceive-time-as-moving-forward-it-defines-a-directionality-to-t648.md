### Method 2: Check your microphone device settings

 Your Corsair HS60 mic may be disabled or not set as the default device on your computer. Or the microphone volume is set to a very low value so it can’t record your sound clearly. Check these settings:

1. **Hold down the Windows logo** **key**  and**the R** **key**  on your keyboard at the same time to bring up the Run dialog, then type “ _**control** **panel**_  ” and press **Enter** .

2. In Control Panel, select Large icons from the View by drop-down menu.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-12.jpg)
3. Select **Sound** .

 Now that the microphone of your headset is enabled and set as the default device, and you’ve turned up your microphone volume, try it and see if it works. If it does, then you’ve solved the problem.

### Method 3: Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your Corsair HS60 headset won’t work if you’re using incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/a5.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to your sound device or your headset to download the latest and correct driver for it.

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047351/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You can also click the **Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — if you don’t already have it, you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/a6-1.jpg)

 Once you’ve updated the driver for your Corsair HS60 headset, restart your computer. Then log in again and see if the microphone is working.

### Method 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If your headset microphone is still not working, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, there are a few things you need to do.

**First** , try connecting your headset to **another port** on your computer. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to the port you’re using.

**Second** , connecting your headset to **another computer** if changing the port doesn’t work for you. If this fixes your microphone, then you should contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 If nothing above helps you, it’s probably your headset has hardware issues. Then you should contact Corsair for support or have your headset serviced.
