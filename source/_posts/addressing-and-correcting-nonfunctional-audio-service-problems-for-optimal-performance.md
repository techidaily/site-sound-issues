### Fix 3 – Allow access to your microphone

 If Sea of Thieves is not allowed to use your microphone, you won’t be able to chat with other players in the game. To check if you’ve enabled the permission, follow the steps below:

1. Type**microphone privacy** in the Windows search bar and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy-settings-2-1.jpg)

3. Scroll down to**toggle on the button next to Sea of Thieves and Xbox** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy-settings-1-2.jpg)

 Open the game to test the voice chat in Sea of Thieves. If it still fails to work, check your audio driver.

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 Faulty or outdated device drivers can lead to various gaming issues. If you don’t remember the last time you update your drivers, definitely do it now, as this could keep your audio devices in tip-top condition and very well tackle the Sea of Theives voice chat not working issue.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update audio driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audio-driver-update-de.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Normally the driver update could fix most device glitches. But if the problem persists, try the next method below.

### Fix 5 – Restart Windows audio service

 If the Windows audio service isn’t running properly, sound problem is likely to occur. To fix it, you need to restart the audio service. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run command. Then type**services.msc** in the field and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audio-service-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**Windows Audio** and select**Restart** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audio-service-2.jpg)

### Fix 6 – Check the in-game audio settings

1. While in-game, press the**Esc key** on your keyboard and select**My Crew** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-1.jpg)

 Now relaunch Sea of Thieves to test. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one below.

### Fix 7 – Check the Party Chat settings

### Fix 8 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 According to some players, Sea of Thieves voice chat won’t work when their antivirus is enabled. The anti-virus software aims to protect your PC from potential threats but sometimes it can block certain features of other apps or games. To see if that’s the cause, turn off the antivirus and relaunch your game. If the problem gets fixed,**add SoT into the exception list** so that you can use both without conflicts.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
