### 1\. Update audio drivers

 A properly working audio driver can make sure your device is working normally. If your Discord picks up the game audio, it might be caused by a malfunctioning audio driver. To make sure your audio works fine, you should update your audio driver:

There’re mainly two ways for you to update an audio driver:

**Manually –** You will need to open Device Manager to expand the Sound, video, and game controllers list, right-click your sound card, and select**Update driver** \>**Search automatically for updated driver software** . You can let Windows update the driver for you, but if it doesn’t work, you can uninstall the driver and restart your PC, or visit your device manufacturer’s website and install the most recent audio/sound drivers for your device.

**Automatically –** Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is quite easy – all done in a few clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You can choose to do it with our FREE Version or purchase the **[Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to unlock more advanced features.
