### Fix 5: Check for corrupted system files

1) Open the Command Prompt as admin.

2) Type “sfc /scannow” and hit enter

3) Restart your computer once finished.

 Alternatively, utilities like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comprehensively scan your entire system for stability issues, damaged files, malware infections, and more. Fortect then repairs corrupted Windows files by replacing them with healthy versions without deleting user data. This**automated repair** process restores system stability and functionality.

 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you **a detailed report of your PC status** .

 3) Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click **Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).
