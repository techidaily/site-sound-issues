 1) Download[**DPC Latency Checker**](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) and click the download file to open it.

 2) If you’re seeing green bars as shown in the screenshot below, and nothing in the top red section, your PC is in a good state. Move on to the next step below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a533a0c245d.png)

 Try disabling your device drivers from Device Manager as shown in **[Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  one by one.

 If you find disabling certain drivers reduce the latency a lot, then you have to reinstall the device drivers to the latest version. You can update all the needed device drivers one by one by yourself. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
