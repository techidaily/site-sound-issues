### Fix 1: Make sure you have not muted the sound

 Sometimes you hear no sound coming through Windows Media Player because youâ€™ve muted the sound unknowingly.

To make sure the volume is not muted but audible:

 1) In**Windows Media Player** , move the slider of the volume control bar to at least half way up.
