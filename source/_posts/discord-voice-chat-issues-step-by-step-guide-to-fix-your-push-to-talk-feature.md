## Before we move further…

 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer. The reset button varies on different Jabra headsets, but normally you could**hold the multi-function button for around 10 seconds** to clear the settings.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-1.jpg)
2. If you see your Jabra headphone is listed under Audio, click it and click**Remove device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-3.jpg)
3. Turn off your Bluetooth for a few seconds and toggle it on.

2. Connect your Jabra headset to the computer and it should be automatically detected by the program.
3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.
