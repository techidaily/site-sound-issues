 If there is no sound from your Dell laptop, you should, first of all, check the hardware problem. Here’s the troubleshooting steps:

#### 1\. Check the speaker on your computer

 Ensure your speaker volume is not muted. Sometimes the volume is muted and you’ll absolutely hear no sound. Just check the**Volume icon** on your desktop, and drag the slider to maximum and see if you can hear any sound.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 In addition, simple take a look at the speaker on your laptop, and see whether there is anything covering upon the speaker.

#### 2\. Check the headphone jack

 You should also check the headphone jack if you’ve plugged into a headphone with your laptop. Look inside the jack and see if there is any damage or dust or lint that may stop your headphone from working properly.

 If so, clean the jacks with a cotton swab or brush.

#### 3\. Check the microphone or headphone

 If you’re connecting a mic or headphone with your laptop, you should also make sure the device is working properly.

 Try disconnecting and reconnecting and see if there is any sound. Or you can try another mic or headphone and see if where the problem lies in.

### Fix 4: Update the audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver can also cause no sound on computer. If uninstalling the driver doesn’t solve your problem, you can try to update the audio driver to have it work.

 There are two ways to update drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update driver** – You can manually update the audio driver by searching on the manufacturer’s website, find the latest and correct driver that is matched with your Windows OS, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update driver** – If you don’t have time or patience to manually update drivers, you can automatically update drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/driver-easy-scan.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged audio device to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version), then install it in your computer.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/driver-easy-update.jpg)

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

 Still no luck? Okay, there’s one more thing to try.
