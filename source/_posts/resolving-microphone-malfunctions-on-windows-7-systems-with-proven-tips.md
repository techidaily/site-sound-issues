6. Click**OK** to save the change.

 Try the CS:GO mic again to see if it works. If the problem remains, please move on.

## Fix 3: Check in-game settings

 Make sure you haven’t turned off any options related to microphone in CS:GO. Usually there won’t be any problems with your default audio settings. That said, you should still check the in-game settings, just in case.

1. Launch CS:GO and click the gear icon in the left pane.

## Fix 5: Verify integrity of game cache files

 This is a quick fix for most problems occurring in Steam games, so it not only applies to CS:GO but also to other games when necessary. Here are the steps that help you verify the integrity of your game cache files:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on your game and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Installed Files** tab and click on the**Verified integrity of game files** button.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 Once you verify that all the cache files are in normal state, please launch CS:GO and check if your mic is working properly this time. In case the problem persists, you should move on to the next fix.

## Fix 7: Check Privacy settings

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5ae0331bc08e4-2.png) and**I** at the same time to open the**Settings** window. Then, select**Privacy** and**Microphone** .
