## Solution for 3.5mm wired headset

 If you’re using a 3.5mm wired headset and the mic not working, you’ll need a[4-pin to 3-pin adapter cable](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Splitter-Computer-Smartphone/dp/B073ZDDTH2/?tag=supereasyen05-20) . Because many headsets use a 4-pin or TRRS plug. This refers to the pin out on the 3.5mm connector, which carries the right audio, left audio, ground, and microphone. You’ll need a 4-pin or TRRS jack that is commonly used on smartphones to plug into. Older desktop PCs and older laptops will have separate jacks for mic and audio.

 Therefore, you need a[headphone splitter](https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Headphone-Splitter-Computer-Smartphone/dp/B073ZDDTH2/?tag=supereasyen05-20) for a 3.5mm wired headset.

 The splitter is**incompatible** with Apple earbuds and Beats headphones. Because Apple uses a different method for their mic and control signaling, so you’ll need a specific product for Apple.

### Fix 1: Allow access to your headset microphone (for Windows 10 users)

 You should allow your Windows 10 system and your application to access your headset microphone before you can use it. To check this:

1. On your desk, right-click on the**Start** button, and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/open-settings-from-start-button.jpg)
2. Select the**Privacy & security** section and click**Microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-settings-privacy-microphone.jpg)
3. Click the Change button, then make sure the**Microphone for this device** is turned**on** . Also, make sure to put**Let apps access your microphone** at On.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/win-11-settings-privacy-microphone-access-1.jpg)
4. Hopefully this fixes your microphone issue. But if not, there are still three fixes you can try.

 The screenshots above are captured from a Windows 11 operating system. If you are using Windows 10 or older versions, be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

### Fix 2: Set your microphone device as default

 Your headset mic may be disabled or not set as the default device on your computer. Or the microphone volume is so low that it can’t record your sound clearly. To check these settings:

1. **Hold down the Windows logo** **key**  and**press the R** **key** on your keyboard at the same time to bring up the Run dialog, then type “_**control**_ ” and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4da30462b97.png)
2. In Control Panel, select**Large icons** from the**View by** drop-down menu.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4da34f9240e.jpg)

### Fix 3: Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your headset won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical, and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install**Driver Easy** .
2. Run**Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.**Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/scan.jpg)
3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to your sound device or your headset to update the latest and correct driver for it. You can also click the **Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer.  
 (You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you are not sure whether Driver Easy is right for you, our free trial version lets you try out the_full features_ of the Pro version for 7 days. You won’t be charged before your trial ends.)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Intel-display-audio-1.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated the driver for your audio devices, restart your computer. Then log in again and see if the microphone is working.

### Fix 4: Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 Sometimes, some communication apps like Discord, Skype, Zoom, etc. can play with your headset microphone when they’re not in use and make your headset mic not working properly. Shutting down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone is the easiest way to do it. Then check whether the problem is solved.

### Fix 5: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If your headset microphone is still not working, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, there are a few things you need to do.

 First, try connecting your headset to**another port** on your computer. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to the port you’re using.

 If changing the port doesn’t work for you, connect your headset to**another computer** and see if this fixes your microphone. If it does, then you should contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 If nothing above helps you, the issues may be on your headset. Then you should contact your headset manufacturer for support or have your headset serviced.
