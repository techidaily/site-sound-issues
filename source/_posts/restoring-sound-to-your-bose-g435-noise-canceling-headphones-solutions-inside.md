### Fix 5: Disable audio enhancements

 Audio enhancements, as the name suggests, are features that allow for highest sound fidelity from your hardware. But depending on your configuration, they can also interfere with your system and trigger sound problems. So we should disable audio enhancements to see if it fixes the no sound on laptop problem.

Here’s how:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .
