 Are you looking for solid solutions for your Oculus Rift S mic not working issue? If yes, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve put together a full list of fixes that have helped other users solve the problem. Read and check it out!

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Do some basic troubleshooting](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Allow access to your microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Change the power management settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Do some basic troubleshooting

 To troubleshoot the temporary device glitches, you could try a few common workarounds:

* **Unplug your Oculus Rift S headset** and**plug it back to the computer** . This should make the headset work, but according to some users, this is only a temporary fix and you need to do the reconnection every time your computer restarts.
* **Try a different USB port** just in case the previous port you use is somehow broken or it can not provide enough power to your headset.

 If you go through the steps above but the problem persists, move on to the more complicated fixes below.

### Fix 2 – Update your device drivers

 The Oculus Rift S mic not working issue is likely to be driver-related. To keep your VR headset running in tip-top condition, you should update your device drivers on a regular basis.

 You can search for the most recent driver from the website of your device manufacturer. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

### Fix 3 – Allow access to your microphone

 If you’re on Windows 10, one of the reasons for mic not working is that your microphone access has been disabled by accident. And you should allow the system and applications to use your Oculus Rift S microphone.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time.
2. On the Windows Settings menu, select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1-1.jpg)
3. Select**Microphone** on the left pane. Then, click the**Change** button and**toggle on** Microphone access for this device.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Scroll down and make sure the switch is**on** under Allow apps to access your microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/privacy-settings-1.jpg)
4. Scroll to the Allow desktop apps to access your microphone section and **toggle on**  the button below.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-4-1.jpg)

 Test your Oculus Rift S mic with a game or program. Still no luck? Check out the next method then.

### Fix 4 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Oculus Rift S headset mic will be set as the default input device once it’s correctly connected. But if it’s not, the mic won’t transmit your voice at all, and you should check the sound settings and make things right.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then, type**control** in the text field and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-1.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by, and then click**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-2.jpg)
3. On the**Recording** tab, make sure your Oculus Rift S Microphone is**enabled** . Then right-click it and select**Set as Default Device** . If you don’t see your microphone listed, tick**Show Disabled Devices** first.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/rift-settings-1.jpg)
4. Click your Oculus Rift S microphone and click**Properties** .

### Fix 5 – Change the power management settings

 Sometimes the computer will turn off your USB root hub to save power, but the bad thing is that the connection will become unstable and even worse your Oculus Rift S mic will stop working. To adjust the settings, follow the steps here:

1. Type**device manager** in the search box and click**Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/device-manager.jpg)
2. Double-click**Universal Serial Bus controllers** . Then right-click**USB Root Hub** from the list and select**Properties** .

3. Navigate to the**Power Management** tab and**untick the box** next to Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/device-manager-3.jpg)
4. If you have more than one USB root hubs, repeat the steps above to disable the power management for them all.
5. Go back to the Device Manager window, double-click**Oculus VR Devices** to expand the category.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/device-manager-4.jpg)
