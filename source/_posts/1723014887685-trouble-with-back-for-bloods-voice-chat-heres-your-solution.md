 Voice chat not working in Back 4 Blood? You’re not alone. Recently many players have reported the very same issue. But don’t worry. In this post, we’ve got you covered with some working fixes you can try.

## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Check your privacy settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Set your audio device as the default device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Connect your microphone directly to your controller](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall Back 4 Blood](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your privacy settings

 If you downloaded Back 4 Blood from the Microsoft Store, make sure your privacy settings are configured properly to allow the game to access your microphone. Here’s how:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/tun-on-allow-apps-to-access-your-microphone.jpg)
4. Launch the game again to see if the voice chat works now.

If the in-game voice chat is still not working, try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The voice chat not working issue can be caused by a corrupted or outdated audio driver. To fix it, you’ll need to update your audio driver.

 One way to do that is to visit your device manufacturer’s website and search for your model, then manually download and install the most recent audio/sound drivers for your device. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
