### Fix 2: Turn off other electronic devices

 One of the possible causes of buzzing sound is electrical interference. It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven, and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1. Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.
2. Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electromagnetic pulse, you should keep your headphones far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 If this fixes the problem, you can turn on electronic devices one by one to check which device causes the interference.

If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 3: Replace your headphones

 If the above fixes don’t work, you should identify the issue is coming from the PC or your headphones.

 Connect a different headset to your computer and check for a buzzing noise. If the issue persists, obviously the issue comes from the PC. But if the buzzing noise disappears, you need to contact the manufacturer’s customer service for help or replace it to a new one.

If the issue is coming from the PC, the next method may help you fix it.
