## Try these fixes

 Here are 4 fixes that helped other users solve**Google Meet mic not working on a Windows PC** . You don’t have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

2. **[Allow access to your microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check your PC sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Before you proceed to the more complicated fixes, try**restarting your browser and computer** . A simple restart can sometimes perfectly resolve the microphone glitch.

### Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If you’re using a faulty, corrupted or outdated audio driver, various audio issues will occur. You may find the microphone is malfunctioning or there’s no sound when using Google Meet. To fix the issue, make sure you install the latest correct audio driver.

 You can update the driver manually ([learn how](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ), but it requires you to be familiar with computer hardware and it’s time-consuming. Alternatively, you can take one click and update all your drivers automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct audio drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your computer for the changes to take full effect. If the driver update doesn’t give you luck, there are more fixes to try.

### Fix 2 – Allow access to your microphone

 To make your microphone work normally, it’s also necessary to allow the operating system, browser and apps to use your microphone. Make sure to turn on the permission especially if you’ve just connected a new mic to your computer. Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-1-2.jpg)
2. Select**Microphone** . Then on the right pane, click the**Change** button and turn Microphone access for this device to**On** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/4-3.jpg)
3. Scroll down and make sure the button under**Allow apps to access your microphone** and**Allow desktop apps to access your microphone** is set to**On** . This makes it possible for your browser to access the microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/allow-access-to-microphone-1.jpg)

 When you complete the steps, check if Google Meet can pick up your voice. If not, move on to the next method below.

### Fix 3 – Check your PC sound settings

 If you have several peripherals connected to the computer, there’s a good chance that your preferred device is not set as default and thus the microphone doesn’t work properly in Google Meet. To see if that’s the case, check the sound settings as follows.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**mmsys.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sound-settings-1.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**Recording** tab. First make sure your microphone is enabled (showing a green checkmark). If it’s not and displays a grey down-arrow icon, right-click it and click**Enable** .

 Test your microphone again to see if it works without problem. If the issue persists, check out the next solution below.

### Fix 4 – Check Google Meet’s settings

 Normally, your browser and Google Meet will use the microphone you set as default on your computer, but in case something messed up, you can manually check if Google Meet is identifying and accessing the correct audio device.

1. Enter your online meeting on Google Meet. Click the**lock icon** at the far right of the Google chrome search bar, and**toggle on the permission to your microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting.jpg)
2. Make sure your microphone is not turned off.
3. Click the**vertical ellipsis icon** at the top left and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-meet-setting-2.jpg)
4. From the drop-down menu under Microphone, select your primary microphone.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 If you still can’t use the microphone in Google Meet, the last resort is to**double-check the physical connection** .

 For example, if you’re using a wired headset, make sure it’s securely plugged in and check if your USB ports are functioning well. If you use a Bluetooth headset, try repairing it to your computer and see how things go.
