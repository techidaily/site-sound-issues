## 1\. Install all Windows Updates

 The feature of Windows Update is to keep Microsoft Windows and several other Microsoft programs updated. Those updates often include feature enhancements and security updates to protect Windows from malware and malicious attacks.

 The audio issues you’re having while playing Outriders may indicate that you need to check for Windows updates in order to get the best possible performance from your operating system. Here’s how you can download and install Windows updates:

 1) In the Search box, type in **check for updates** . Click **Check for updates**  from results.

## 2\. Run your game in compatibility mode

 Here’s how to change the compatibility mode settings for Outriders:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

## 3\. Update your audio driver

 Whenever you run into audio issues such as the audio is out of sync or cutting out, you need to check whether you’re using a faulty or outdated audio driver. If your audio driver is misconfigured or outdated, you would just hear a crackling or distorted sound and encounter other audio issues. Therefore, you need to update your audio driver as this action may fix your issue immediately.

 You can update your audio driver from the PC or device maker’s support downloads page. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and you need to know the specifications of your PC.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and **detect any problem drivers** .

![update network adapter driver automatically with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

## 4\. Verify integrity of game files

 For Steam games, there is a built-in tool called “verify integrity of game files”. It is a generic troubleshooting step that can help ensure that the installation of a game is up-to-date and if necessary, repair any bad or corrupted game data. When your in-game audio isn’t working properly, it could be a sign that your game files are corrupted or missing. To fix it, you should verify the integrity of game files:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/outriders-Properties.png)

 2) Select**LOCAL FILES** tab and then click on the**Verify integrity of game files…** button.  
  
![verify integrity of game files Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/outriders-verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

 Steam will start verifying your game’s files and this may take several minutes. Simply wait for the process to complete.

 Once finished, play Outriders and check if this brings your in-game audio back to a normal state.

## 5\. Disable audio enhancements in Windows

Here’s how:
