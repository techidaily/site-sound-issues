## Conexant HD Audio Not Working in Windows 11? Here's How to Restore Sound

After upgrading system to Windows 10 or performing a Windows 10 update, if you encounter no sound issue with Conexant SmartAudio HD, you can try solutions below  
to fix the problem.
  
**Solution 1: Update the Conexant SmartAudio HD Driver**

Drivers can always be downloaded in Support or Download section of the website.
