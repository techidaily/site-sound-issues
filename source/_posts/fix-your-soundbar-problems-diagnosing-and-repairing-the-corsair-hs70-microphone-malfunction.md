### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 To enjoy the best VR gameplay, you should make sure **all device drivers (graphics, USB and audio driver in particular)** are up-to-date. If your audio or Oculus headset driver is faulty or outdated, it’s likely the Quest 2 mic won’t work properly. So you should update it to see if that fixes the problem. There are two ways you can get the right driver for your headset:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for Oculus Quest 2 from the[**Oculus support page**](https://support.oculus.com/) . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Option 2 – Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your computer hardware and Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/de-borderless-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to the flagged_Oculus VR Headset driver_ or any devices to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all the drivers_ that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 4 – Unplug and replug your headset

 Some users reported the standard unplug-and-replug method dramatically solved the Quest 2 mic not working problem, but note that you need to run the Windows voice recorder while doing this.

1. Plug the headset into your PC and enable Oculus Link.
2. Type**Voice** in the Windows search box and click**Voice Recorder** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/voice-recorder.jpg)
3. If Oculus Quest 2 is picked up in Voice Recorder, start SteamVR or your game and the mic should work as intended.

 If not,**keep the Voice Recorder running** . Then,**unplug the cable** from your headset,**replug it back in** ,**enable Oculus Link** on Quest 2 and start your game.

 Now check if your microphone works again. If yes, then great, but you might need to pull the mic command via the Voice Recorder every time you start SteamVR or other programs. This known bug might be fixed in the later Oculus patches.

 If none of the steps above do the trick, try to**reinstall the latest Oculus app** from the[**official website**](https://www.oculus.com/setup/) and see if the problem gets fixed.
