 If your audio problem remains, don’t worry, you need to update your audio drivers. Move on to method 4 for help.

## Fix 4: Update the Bluetooth and audio drivers

 Wrong or outdated Bluetooth adapter and audio drivers could be the reason for the Bluetooth audio stuttering issue. So you should ensure that these drivers are updated to the latest versions.
