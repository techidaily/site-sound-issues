## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

3. Navigate to the**Recording** tab, and make sure your Logitech G Pro X headset microphone is**enabled** (there should be a green checkmark). Then, click the microphone and click**Set Default** .

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
