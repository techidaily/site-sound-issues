## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your headset from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
