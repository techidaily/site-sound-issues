## 1\. Make sure your microphone is not muted

 This may be hard to believe, but there are cases when the Realtek microphone is back to working again when people just switch the mute button off. This is especially true on laptops with physical switches or function keys to mute and unmute the microphone.

 So the first thing you do when your Realtek microphone doesn’t work is to make sure that it’s not muted by any physical button or function key.

 If you’re not sure if you have such a setting on your computer, you can always check your computer manual for more details.

 When you’re sure that this is not the reason why your Realtek microphone is not working, please move further to the other fixes below.

---

## 2\. Update Windows

 If the Realtek microphone not working problem just happens all of a sudden, it’s likely related to outdated or faulty system files. This is because outdated or corrupted system files could cause compatibility issues with computer services such as audio ones. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png)
2. Click**Check for updates** , and Windows will scan for any available updates.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-19.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Restart your computer for the update to take effect if needed.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-20.png)
4. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll see**You’re up to date** like this.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-21.png)

 Then try your Realtek microphone again to see if it works properly now. If the problem remains, please move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Update the sound card driver

 An outdated or incorrect sound card driver could also be the culprit to your Realtek microphone not working problem, so if the above two methods don’t help to restore your microphone, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated audio driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.

## 4\. Use the sound card driver from your computer manufacturer

 If the latest driver for the Realtek sound card doesn’t help to fix its microphone not working problem, it’s time to consider a different driver, and the one from your computer manufacturer is the go-to option.

 The sound card driver from your computer manufacturer in most cases is older than the one provided by Driver Easy. This is because your computer manufacturer needs extra time to customize the driver files so they work better on their computers, while Driver Easy usually gets the latest driver from Realtek directly.

 To find the correct sound card driver from your manufacturer, you first need to know your computer brand and model. You can follow the instructions here:[**How to view the entire computer specs through System Information**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to check your system specs in the**System Information** tool.

 Once you have your computer specs, you can then search keyword combinations like your computer manufacturer plus its model to find the correct driver download page:

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-53.png)

 For instance, my keyword combination should be**Dell Vostro 3670 driver download**

 Go only to the official website of your manufacturer, then find the driver for your Realtek sound card, and download and install the correct driver for your computer.

 If the above steps are too much for you to follow, or if you don’t have the time or energy to find the correct driver for your computer, you can always talk to[Driver Easy support](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) (which comes with[**Driver Easy Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ) and they’ll help you out.

## 5\. Repair corrupted or damaged system files

**Repairing corrupted or damaged system files** could also help fix issues like the Realtek microphone not working on PC. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause all sorts of problems that affect the overall system performance.

 By repairing the core Windows system files, it may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to instability and incompatibility with system services and programs. Tools like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can automate the repair process by scanning system files and replacing corrupted ones.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

## 6\. Update BIOS

 If the above still doesn’t help to fix the Realtek microphone not working issue on your computer, you may need to consider a BIOS update, as it could be a problem between the Realtek sound card on the motherboard and your system. But you should always check your motherboard’s BIOS update release note to see if the microphone issue is mentioned.

 If you’re up for a BIOS update, here’s a post on how you can do it manually:[**How to Update BIOS on Windows 11**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 DO NOT attempt a BIOS update if you’re not 100% confident in knowing what you’re doing, as a faulty BIOS update could harm or even brick your computer.

---

## 7\. Reset your computer

 If none of the above helps to restore your Realtek microphone, not even the BIOS update, you may need to consider a Windows reset: it wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems, it’s also the rule of thumb in telling a software problem from a hardware one: if the problem remains even after a system reset, then it’s definitely a hardware problem.

 To reinstall or reset your computer, here’s a post for your reference: [ **Reinstall/Reset Windows 10 \[Step By Step\]** ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 If the Realtek microphone remains not working even after a reset, then the next thing you should do is seek help from a hardware technician to see if your hardware components (the motherboard or the Realtek sound card) are at fault.

## 8\. Final thought

 If you’ve tried fixes 1 to 6 mentioned here but are a bit reluctant to try a system reset, you can also an easier (and rather inexpensive) alternative: an external USB sound card.

 It works as an external USB sound card, so you don’t need to use the built-in Realtek one for your microphone, which is an easy workaround if you don’t want a system reset, or get your motherboard or sound card repaired.

 Hope one of the methods above helps to fix the Realtek microphone not working problem for you, or at least point you in the right direction. If you have other suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment below.
