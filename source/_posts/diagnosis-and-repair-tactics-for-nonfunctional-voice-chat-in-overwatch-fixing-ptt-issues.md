If this doesn’t do the trick, proceed to the next fix.

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 Audio issues can arise if you’re using an**outdated audio driver** . To fix the Discord echo problem, you should give updating the audio driver a try. This may be the best shot you can take without much troubleshooting. You can update your audio driver manually using the Device Manager utility in Windows or go to your sound card manufacturer to search for driver updates.

 But if you don’t have the time or patience to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater. It’ll detect any outdated drivers and then download, and install the latest drivers for your system. All are done with a few mouse clicks.
