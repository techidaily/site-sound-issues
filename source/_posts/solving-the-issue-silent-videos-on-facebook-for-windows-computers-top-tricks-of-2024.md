## 1\. Check the basics

 To efficiently identify the source of the problem, you need to confirm that your audio device is functioning properly. If you’re using external speakers, check the power source and connections. Check if they’re working properly on other devices.

## 2\. Install all Windows updates

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**check for updates** and click**Check for updates** from the list of results.
