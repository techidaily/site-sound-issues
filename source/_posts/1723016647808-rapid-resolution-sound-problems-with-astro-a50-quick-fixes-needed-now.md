## Fix 1: Troubleshoot the connection

 The first thing you need to try is to make sure the headset’s volume wheel is set to a reasonable value.

 Then, you need to check if the Base Station and your headset are synced together.

1. Ensure the Mode Switch on the Base Station is set to the right device (PC or PS4).
2. Place A50 headset on the Base Station, and make sure it’s seated correctly.
3. Once synced together, you will see the LED lights on the front of the Base Station will starting Blinking.
4. Make sure the optical cable is fully plugged into the “**MICRO USB** ” and the other end of the cable is plugged firmly into the USB port of your PC.

5. Ensure that the game voice balance on the right ear cup of the headset is somewhere in the middle.

4. Test the audio.

If the problem remains, you can move on to the next method.

## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

### Option 2: Update your sound card driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your sound card, and your variant of Windows, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6_0_scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)

4. Test the audio.

 If the sound problem only happens in a certain application or game, please make sure the audio is configured correctly.

 But your Astro 50 no sound issue persists whatsoever, you can try connecting your headset to another computer and see if it’s working properly. If it does, then you should[contact Astro Support](https://www.astrogaming.com/en-us/support.html) for further troubleshooting steps or have your headset replaced.
