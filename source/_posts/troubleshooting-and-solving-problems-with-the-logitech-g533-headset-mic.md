### **Fix 3: Update your audio driver**

 An outdated or corrupted audio driver can also be the root of this issue. To fix it, you just need to update your audio driver to the latest version.

There are two ways to update your sound card driver: **manually**  and **automatically** .

 Be sure to choose the driver**that’s compatible with your exact sound card model** and**your version of Windows** .

**Or**

1. Try connecting your Logitech G633 to **another port**  on your computer. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to the next step, below.
2. Try connecting your Logitech G633 to **another computer** . If your mic works on another PC, you should contact the vendor of your PC for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work on another PC, you should contact Logitech for support.
