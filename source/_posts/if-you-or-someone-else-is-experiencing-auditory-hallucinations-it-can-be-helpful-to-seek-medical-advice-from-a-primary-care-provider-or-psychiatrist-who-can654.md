### Fix 3: Update your audio drivers

 The problem can be caused by incorrect, outdated audio driver or headset driver. You can try to update the driver to fix the problem.

 You can update the driver manually, but if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 After updating the driver, restart your computer and check to see if your Corsair HS70 mic is working.

### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If the above fixes don’t resolve the problem, your Corsair HS70 mic not working might be caused by hardware issues. The mic or the port on the computer might have physical issues. To troubleshoot hardware issues, you can do these things:

 1) Connect your Corsair HS70 mic to another port on your computer. If your mic works on another port, it means something is wrong with the first port.

 2) Use your Corsair HS70 mic on another computer to see if it works. If it works on another computer, it means there are some problems with your computer. You need to make a further check about the computer problem. You can contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 3) If your mic is still not working, you might need to send it to the manufacturer to have it fixed, or replace it with a new mic.
