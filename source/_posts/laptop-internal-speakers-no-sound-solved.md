## Fix 4: Update**your sound card driver**

 If the 1-3 fixes didn’t solve your issue, make sure to update your sound card driver.

 To update the sound driver, you can choose to use Device Manager again. Microsoft can find the latest driver for you. But for some reason, sometimes Microsoft cannot detect the latest driver. As a result, it told you: The best driver software for your device is already installed. To avoid missing the latest driver, you have a perfect choice — using the extremely helpful driver tool — **Driver Easy** .

It has two versions. Have a try on its **[Free Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , it will offer the latest drivers for you to install. But if you upgrade to **[PRO Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , you can get all your drivers including the sound card driver up-to-date with just one click — **Update All** (you get full tech support and 30-day money back guarantee).
