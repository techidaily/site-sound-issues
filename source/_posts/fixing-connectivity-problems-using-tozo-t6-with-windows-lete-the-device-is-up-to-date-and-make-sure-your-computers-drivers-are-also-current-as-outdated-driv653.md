### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If the above fixes don’t resolve the problem, your Corsair HS70 mic not working might be caused by hardware issues. The mic or the port on the computer might have physical issues. To troubleshoot hardware issues, you can do these things:

 1) Connect your Corsair HS70 mic to another port on your computer. If your mic works on another port, it means something is wrong with the first port.

 2) Use your Corsair HS70 mic on another computer to see if it works. If it works on another computer, it means there are some problems with your computer. You need to make a further check about the computer problem. You can contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 3) If your mic is still not working, you might need to send it to the manufacturer to have it fixed, or replace it with a new mic.
