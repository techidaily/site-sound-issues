### Fix 1: Troubleshoot the hardware issue

 When you find that the sound is not working or there’s no sound in your Skype, the first thing to do is to troubleshoot the hardware issue, such as your microphone or your headset.  1) Make sure that your microphone or headset are plugged properly and firmly into the correct jacks.  2) Make sure that your microphone or your headset works properly. You can try your microphone or headset on another device to see if it works or not.

### Fix 2: Update Skype in your device

 The developer keeps releasing the latest patch for Skype to fix some bug issues and improve your experience, so there may be some problem, including the sound problem in the older version of Skype, and you can install the latest update for Skype and keep it up to date. Then check if it fixes the no sound issue in Skype.

### Fix 3: Check the audio settings in your computer

 The incorrect audio settings in your computer can cause the no sound issue in your Skype, so you should check and make sure the audio settings are set properly.

#### Step 1: Make sure the audio volume is not mute

 As you may know, if your computer’s sound volume is set too low or muted, you can’t hear any sound from your Skype. You should click the sound volume on your desktop, and drag the slider to medium or peak, and test again to see if there is any sound from your Skype.

If you’re using Windows 10, 8.1 and 8:  1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows log key![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59b0b16974940.png)**  and**I** at the same time.  2) Click**Privacy** in Settings.

### Fix 4: Update available drivers

 The missing or outdated drivers for your microphone/headset or your camera can cause the no sound issue in your computer. So you should verify that the drivers in your computer are up to date, and update those that aren’t.  There are two ways to update drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .  Manually update drivers: you can manually search for the latest version of the device driver from the manufacturer, then download and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills. As the device driver vary from devices and manufacturers, so we won’t cover it here, and we recommend this method if you’re confident with your computer skills.  Automatically update drivers: if you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you will get full support and**a 30-day money back guarantee** ).  1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.  2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), and install the driver in your computer.  Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **_Update All_** ).

 4) Restart your computer to take effect, and check if there’s any sound in your Skype.

### Fix 5: Modify the audio settings in your Skype

 The improper audio settings in your Skype can also cause the no sound issue in Skype, you should check the following settings:  1) Make sure to**allow calls from anyone** . This eliminates failing to call if the person isn’t in your contact list.  2) Make sure to detect**Speakers** and**Microphone** in the Audio settings. If one of the audio devices is not detected, you’ll have the no sound issue.  3) Try to switch the Speakers or Microphone from the detected device, and see if it works.  That’s it.
