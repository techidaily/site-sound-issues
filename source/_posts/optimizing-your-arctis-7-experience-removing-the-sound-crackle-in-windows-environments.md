**[Step 2: Set Default Microphones](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
**[Step 3: Update Audio Driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
  
 **Step 1: First Things First**
  
 1) Plug out the microphone from the original jack on your PC and then plug it back on again. Make sure that you plug your microphone in to the right port. See if your microphone works in this way.
  
 2) Try use the same microphone on another computer if you have one. If not, you can use it on your friend’s PC to have a test. If sound comes out right, that means your microphone is to blame. You might need to consider getting a new microphone.
  
 3) If your microphone doesn’t work on certain program but not the others, you might need to dive in the settings in that program to check if microphone is allowed. Also, please check if you need to update these programs since upgrade might help you with some of the minor conflicts or problems.
  
 **Step 2:** **Set Default Microphones**

 1) Right click the volume icon and then choose**Playback devices** .
