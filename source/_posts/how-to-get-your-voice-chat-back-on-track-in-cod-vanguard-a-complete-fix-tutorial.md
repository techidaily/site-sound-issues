### Fix 2: Allow the game to access your microphone

 If you’re having trouble with your microphone, make sure your privacy settings are configured properly to allow the game to access your microphone. Here’s how:

1. If COD: Vanguard is open, close the game entirely.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/privacy.jpg)
3. In the left panel, select**Microphone** . Under**Allow desktop apps to access your microphone** , make sure the toggle is set to**ON** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/microphone-allow-desktop-apps.jpg)

 After you’ve done these, relaunch Vanguard to see if your voice chat works properly.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, check out the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 The COD: Vanguard voice chat not working issue can also be triggered by a faulty or outdated audio driver. If you can’t remember the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now as this might solve your problem right away.

 There are mainly two ways to update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-scan-audio.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 5: Check in-game audio settings

 To enable the voice chat feature in Vanguard, you should also make sure the in-game audio settings are set up properly. Here’s how:

1. Launch Call of Duty: Vanguard. Go to**Settings** .
2. Select**ACCOUNT & NETWORK** . Under the**ONLINE** section, set**CROSSPLAY** and**CROSSPLAY COMMUNICATION** to**ON** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vanguard-crossplay-on.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**AUDIO** tab. Under the**Voice Chat** section, make sure**VOICE CHAT** is set to**On** . Set**VOICE CHAT DEVICE** and**MICROPHONE DEVICE** to**Default Communication Device** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vanguard-voice-chat-on.jpg)
4. According to your personal preference, set**MICROPHONE ACTIVATION MODE** to**Open Mic** or**Push to Talk** . If you set it to**Open Mic** , make sure**OPEN MIC ACTIVATION THRESHOLD** is set to**3** . But if you set it to**Push to Talk** , please be sure you’re aware of exactly what button you’d need to press to activate your microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vanguard-microphone-activation-mode.jpg)
5. Set**VOICE CHAT VOLUME** and**MICROPHONE VOLUME** to a moderate value. Then set**VOICE CHAT EFFECT** to**No Effect** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vanguard-voice-chat-volume.jpg)

Now you can restart Vanguard and check if the voice chat is working.

If your problem remains, try the last fix.
