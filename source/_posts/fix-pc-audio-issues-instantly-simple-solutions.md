### **Fix 2: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the **crackling or popping sound** in headphone  problem. To disable **Exclusive Mode** :

 1) On the bottom right of your screen, right-click on**the sound icon** , then click**Sounds** .
