## Fix 1: Set your microphone as default device

 It is best practice to set your microphone as the default device when you come across the mic-not-working issue. To do so, you need to perform the following procedure:

1. At the bottom right corner of your computer screen – namely the notification area – you’ll find the**volume icon** . Right-click on it and select**Sound settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/win-11-right-click-on-sound.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click on**More sound settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win-11-sound-settings.jpg)
3. Select the**Recording** tab. Right-click on the device that you’re currently using and then select**Set as Default Device** from its context menu.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-334.png)
4. Click to highlight your default microphone and then click**Properties** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-346.png)
5. On the**Levels** tab, drag the sliders of**Microphone** and**Microphone Boost** to turn up the volume. Just make sure you haven’t muted them or set them to such low levels that you cannot hear the voice yourself. After that, click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-393.png)
6. You may do a voice test by speaking into your mic. If the recording device is working properly, you should witness a rise in the green bar as you talk.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf47cf4729b.jpg)
7. Right-click on other recording devices and select**Disable** to turn them off temporarily. If you’d like to turn them on after playing CS:GO, simply repeat this step and select**Enable** .  

 Also, if you have other output devices, go to the**Playback** tab and disable them (except the one in use) in the same way as you did on the**Recording** tab.
8. After everything’s done, click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-335.png)

 Now it’s time to launch CS:GO and see whether your mic is working properly. If not, please proceed to the next fix below.

## Fix 2: Disable exclusive control for your microphone

 If the above sound setting modifications don’t help to restore your CS:GO mic, you can try to disable the Allowing executive control of microphone feature, as it’s proven to be effective by some community gamers. To do so:

1. At the bottom right corner of your computer screen – namely the notification area – you’ll find the**volume icon** . Right-click on it and select**Sound settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/win-11-right-click-on-sound.jpg)
2. Scroll down and click on**More sound settings** .

 Try the CS:GO mic again to see if it works. If the problem remains, please move on.

## Fix 3: Check in-game settings

 Make sure you haven’t turned off any options related to microphone in CS:GO. Usually there won’t be any problems with your default audio settings. That said, you should still check the in-game settings, just in case.

1. Launch CS:GO and click the gear icon in the left pane.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-338.png)
2. Go to the**Audio Settings** tab and select**Audio** below. Then, pay attention to the related audio settings and make certain they are**turned on** or set to the correct state.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-339.png)
3. Select**Game Settings** **\> Communication** . Make sure you haven’t muted your friends or others in the game. (This is not necessarily related to your mic, so you may skip this step if you want.)  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2090698/16836" target="_top" id="2090698"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2090698" border="0" alt="" width="720" height="300"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-345.png)
4. Go to**Controller** . Below you’ll see the item –**Use Mic** . If there’s already a shortcut key assigned to it, then you don’t need to change anything; otherwise please assign a shortcut key to it. (The default key is**K** .)  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-396.png)

 When you’re all set, join a squad to see if you can use the mic properly. If not, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Update device drivers

## Fix 5: Verify integrity of game cache files

 This is a quick fix for most problems occurring in Steam games, so it not only applies to CS:GO but also to other games when necessary. Here are the steps that help you verify the integrity of your game cache files:

1. Launch Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on your game and select**Properties** from the drop-down menu.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties.jpg)
3. Select the**Installed Files** tab and click on the**Verified integrity of game files** button.  

![Steam - how to verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Steam-verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

 Once you verify that all the cache files are in normal state, please launch CS:GO and check if your mic is working properly this time. In case the problem persists, you should move on to the next fix.

---

## Fix 6: Restart the Windows Audio service

 Chances are your Windows Audio service is running into glitches that prevent the mic from working normally. In this case you should restart the service and see if that gets your mic back on track.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5ae0331bc08e4-2.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**services.msc** and click **OK** .

2. In the pop-up window, scroll through the list of services to locate**Windows Audio** . Click to highlight this item and click**Restart** in the left pane.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf52397a39c.jpg)

If this fix didn’t help, you might try out the next one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 7: Check Privacy settings

 There’s a possibility that your privacy settings related to the microphone has been reset after a Windows update or other events. If that’s the case, CS:GO might be forbidden to access your mic. To modify the privacy settings, you should perform the following procedure:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows Logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/img_5ae0331bc08e4-2.png) and**I** at the same time to open the**Settings** window. Then, select**Privacy** and**Microphone** .

4. Scroll down and head to the part of**Choose which apps can access your microphone** . You won’t see Steam or CS:GO there but you can toggle on the apps related to your audio output. For instance, if you use Skype to communicate in games, make sure you turn its toggle on.

 After making these tweaks, check to see if your mic goes back to normal in CS:GO. If not, there’s still one last fix you may try.
