* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .
