### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before we make any changes, we might have to troubleshoot hardware issues. To do so:

 1) Make sure to check your **LusidSound LS30** headset for loose cables or the wrong jack.

 2) Try connecting your **LusidSound LS30** to a different port and see if this fixes the problem.

 Check if the microphone is still not working. If yes, then great. But if it’s not working, move on to **Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes the mic on your**LusidSound LS30** won’t work simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) On the lower-right of your computer screen, click**the sound icon** and move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.

 If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.  

 2) Test if your LS30 headset is working properly. If not, then move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Adjust your audio settings

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually and set its sound levels.

To do so:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .
