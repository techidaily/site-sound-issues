## Fix 1: Tweak in-game Settings

 1) Go to**Settings** \>**Audio** .

 2) Adjust the volume as needed.

#### Disable in-game voice chat

 Another fix that works for many players is disabling the in-game voice chat mode. Here’s how to do it:

 1) Go to**Settings > Communication** .

 2) Set VOICE CHAT MODE to**DISABLE** .

## Fix 2: Disable Audio Enhancements

 While some audio drivers use software enhancements to improve sound quality, the feature could cause the New World audio issue if your audio driver isn’t working properly—or if your CPU is being taxed too heavily.

**1)** Right-click the **Volume Control icon** on the taskbar, and select **Sounds** .

**2)** Right-click the audio device you’re using, then select Properties.

 \*If you don’t have the Enhancements tab, click the **Advanced tab** instead, then uncheck **Enable audio enhancements** .

**4)**  Click **APPLY > OK** .

 If turning off Audio Enhancements didn’t fix the audio issue with New World, read on and try the fix below.

## Fix 3: Turn off Exclusive Mode

**Exclusive mode** allows applications to take exclusive control of an audio device’s driver so that other apps running at the same time cannot play sound. If you have the feature enable, it might cause issues when switching audio apps.

**1)** Right-click the **Volume Control icon** on the taskbar, and select **Sounds** .

4) Open the game to see if the audio works now.

If the sound problem still happens, try the next fix below.

## Fix 4: Verify the Integrity of Game Files

 Bad or corrupted game data can also cause game issues like this. To see if this is the case for you, you can verify New World game files from Steam:

1) Launch Steam and go to your Steam Library.

2) Right-click**New World** and select **Properties** .

3) Under the **LOCAL FILES** tab, click **Verify integrity of game files** .

4) Restart the game after the process is complete.

If the audio bug still exists, move on to the next fix below.

## Fix 5: Update Your Audio Driver

 In most cases, audio glitches occur when you’re using the faulty audio driver, or the driver is outdated. You want to keep your audio driver up-to-date so it can work perfectly with new systems and programs. (If you’re using headphones, also make sure your headphone driver is updated. )

 You can manually check the driver for your sound card by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DE-scan-10.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update button** next to the audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 You can do it for free if you want, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

4) Restart your computer and the game to test your issue.

If the sound is still missing, go ahead with the next fix.

## Fix 6: Check for Windows Updates

 If the sound is playing normally outside of New World, it’s unlikely that the out-of-date Windows version is the core problem, but you should still rule out the possibility.

Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

**2)**  Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.
