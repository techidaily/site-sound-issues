 **Before you try the solutions, ensure this is not a hardware issue** :

 If your computer has another port, _**plug your headphones to another por** t_ and see if the problem still persists.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your sound card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install the driver correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
