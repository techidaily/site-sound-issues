### Fix 1: Update your audio driver

 It’s likely your audio driver becomes incompatible after upgrading Windows system, so it’s recommended to update your audio driver to fix the no sound issue.

 There are two ways you can get the right audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct audio driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version of Driver Easy).  
 Or click**Update** **All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

4. Restart your computer to take effect.

Check if there’s any sound in your computer.

 If the problem still persists, don’t worry. We have other solutions.

### Fix 2: Check audio settings

 The improper audio settings can also result in the no sound issue in your computer, so you should configure the audio settings properly.

To do so:

1. Right click on the**Volume icon** at the bottom right corner, and click**Sounds** (or**Playback devices** ).

2. In the**Sound** pane, click the**Playback** tab.
