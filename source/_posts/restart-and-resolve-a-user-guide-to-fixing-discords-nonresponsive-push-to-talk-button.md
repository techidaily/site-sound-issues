 Why is there no sound after Windows 10 update? It’s likely that the new update causes conflicts with the sound card in your computer, or the update includes incompatible components with your sound card driver. Even the audio settings that are changed by the update can result in the issue.

 There are two ways you can get the right audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct audio driver for your sound card and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install it correctly:
