1\. Run the Epic Games Launcher.

 2\. On the left panel, click **Library** . On the right, click **the gear button** on the lower-right corner of **Fortnite** .

 Run Fortnite again to check whether your chat problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to Fix 4, below.

### Fix 4: Make sure your microphone is on for Fortnite

 1\. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .

3\. Run Fortnite to see if chat works now. If not, try Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 Windows and Fortnite both have audio settings, and sometimes things just get a little mixed up. So it can help to reset everything, manually, to clear out the cobwebs. (Kinda like how restarting your PC can sometimes mysteriously resolve problems.) Here is how to do it:

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.
