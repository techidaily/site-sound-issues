## Troubleshooting Tips: How To Get Your Corsair Earphones Back In Action

If you’re using a Corsair headset but it’s not working as expected, i.e. no sound or the microphone not functioning, you’re not alone. This type of issue is usually caused by the improper settings, an outdated audio driver or firmware. But don’t worry. This post will show you all the easy & quick solutions.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t need to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Troubleshoot hardware issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update the firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall iCUE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you can do some troubleshooting via the steps below.

* **Test your Corsair on the other computer** to make sure it’s not physicially broken.
* Repair the connection. Simply**replug the Corsair headset** into your PC and**try another USB port** .  

 If you’re using the wireless dongle, use a paper clip to**press into the tiny hole** near the dongle’s LED. When it starts to blink, hold the**Power button** on your headset until the dongle’s LED turns solid.

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Corsair headset will be set as default automatically once it’s connected properly. But if you’ve constantly changed between the headsets and speakers, the settings might be messed up. And you’ll need to configure the correct setup manually.

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-0.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by and click**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-1.jpg)
3. On the**Playback** tab, make sure your Corsair headset is enabled (covered with a green check mark). Then, click it and click**Set Default** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sound-settings-4-1.jpg)
5. Click**OK** to save the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sound-settings-5.jpg)

 Once completed, check if your Corsair headset functions well. If not, try to troubleshoot the firmware.

## Fix 4 – Update the firmware

 A firmware update, which includes performance improvement and bug fixes, is necessary for the proper functioning of devices. If your Corsair headset somehow stops working, try updating the firmware to see if that helps your case.

1. Connect your Corsair headset to the computer.
2. Launch iCUE. If you don’t have one, **[download it](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/icue)**  .
3. Navigate to the**Settings** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-1-1.jpg)
4. Select your headset first, then check**Force update** and click the**Update** button.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/firmware-update.jpg)

 Wait for the process to complete and see how your headset works. Still no luck with the firmware update? Don’t worry. Check out the last solution.
