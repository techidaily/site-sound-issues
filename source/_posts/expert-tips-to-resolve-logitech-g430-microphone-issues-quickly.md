## Try these fixes

 You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the fix that works.

2. **[Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Before you begin

 Before you start trying the fixes below, you should simply have a basic check on your headset as follows:

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings and then select**Privacy** .

4. Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.

To check if thatâ€™s the case and solve the problem, you can try a USB audio card. Itâ€™s an external device that can**bypass**   **issues in your built-in sound card or audio port, and recover the audio function** when you need to use your Logitech headset mic.
