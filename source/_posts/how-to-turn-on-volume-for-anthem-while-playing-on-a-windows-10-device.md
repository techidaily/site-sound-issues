## Fixes to try

 Here’re some advanced solutions for your**Speaker Setup (UNKNOWN)** error. You might not have to try them all. Simply work down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Install or update your audio driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Run the audio troubleshooter**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Change the startup type of audio services](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Check if your system is corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reset your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Install all Windows updates

 Theoretically, Windows automatically installs the corresponding updates and drivers once you plugged in your peripherals. But that’s not always the case, especially when you’ve changed the update settings.

So you can follow these steps to install all system updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** (the i key) at the same time. This will open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .

2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then search and install available system updates. This might take up to an hour depending on your Internet speed.

3. Once completed, restart your computer.

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  system updates, repeat these steps until you see “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 If your problem persists after updating your system, please continue to the next solution.

### Fix 2: Install or update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of this error is**missing or outdated device drivers** . If Windows failed to find or install the correct driver for your audio device, you will need to do it yourself.

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting the hardware manufacturer’s website, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs_any_ driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
