## Before getting started

 Before proceeding to the following fixes,**restart your device and Discord** . A simple restart gives your system a clean state and fresh start.

 Then you need to make sure that**the volume is not set too high** . Otherwise, the voice breakage can occur.

 However, if your problem persists after you’ve taken these steps, you’ll need to make some changes on your Discord and Windows settings.

## How to stop Discord echo

Follow the steps below in order until you fix your issue.

1. **[Tweak Discord settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Change Windows settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Download & Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 Audio issues can arise if you’re using an**outdated audio driver** . To fix the Discord echo problem, you should give updating the audio driver a try. This may be the best shot you can take without much troubleshooting. You can update your audio driver manually using the Device Manager utility in Windows or go to your sound card manufacturer to search for driver updates.

 But if you don’t have the time or patience to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater. It’ll detect any outdated drivers and then download, and install the latest drivers for your system. All are done with a few mouse clicks.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with outdated drivers.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.  

 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money-back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/update-audio-driver-automatically-with-Driver-Easy.png)
