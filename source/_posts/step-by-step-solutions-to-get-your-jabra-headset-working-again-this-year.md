## Before we move further…

 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

1. Disconnect your Jabra headset from other devices (like your mobile phone) and leave your computer only to see if it works properly.
2. Restart your computer and your Jabra headset, then try the connection again.
3. Make sure that your Jabra headset is fully charged.
4. Make sure that your computer and Jabra headset are still in Bluetooth range and connected.
5. Try to reset your Jabra headset to its default status, then try the connection again.

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your computer is corrupted, faulty or outdated, a headset may not connect to the PC or work correctly. You may find the mic is malfunctioning or there’s no sound at all. In this case, you should run a scan and**install the latest correct audio driver** .

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.

4. Select the language you prefer and click**Update** .

5. Click**Ok** when the update completes.
