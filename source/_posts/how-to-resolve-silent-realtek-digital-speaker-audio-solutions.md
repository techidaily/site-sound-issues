### Fix 1: Rule out the obvious

 Sometimes the reason why we can’t hear sound from Chrome can be obvious yet easily neglected. So we might need to rule out the obvious first:

1. Make sure sound**isn’t mute** on your computer. And if there’s a volume control on the web app, make sure the sound is**audible** too.
2. Double check that sound works properly in desktop apps and/or other Internet browsers like Internet Explorer, Firefox etc. (except Chrome).

 If**no sound at all** comes from any desktop apps or browsers on your computer, then it isn’t really a**Chrome-no-sound** issue, you might want to refer[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for further assistance.

### Fix 2: Update your sound driver

 The**Chrome no sound** problem may occur if you’re using the wrong or corrupt sound driver on your system. So you should update your sound driver to see if it fixes the issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd6e9cb799c4.jpg)

 4) Restart your computer and check if sound works properly on Chrome. If the problem still exists, then move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Check volume mixer

**Volume mixer** is a feature in Windows that allows us to adjust the volumes for individual apps. If sound plays properly on apps other than Chrome, chances are you might have muted the volume for Chrome. To check and un-mute:

1. Right-click on the sound icon  on the lower-right of your screen, then click**Open Volume Mixer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1df14ca9334.jpg)
2. Make sure you’ve moved the**volume slider** for**Chrome** to at least halfway up.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1df24a53f15.jpg)  
 If the volume controller for Chrome isn’t listed here, you can play audio/video on Chrome and then it should pop up.
3. Re-launch Chrome and play some audio/video and see if you can hear the sound. If the Chrome no sound problem persists, move on to**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4:   Make sure the page is not mute

 Another possible reason for this**Chrome-no-sound** problem is**sound is mute on Internet page** . To set things right:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **inetcpl.cpl**  into the box and click OK.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/image-31.png)

 2) Click the **Advanced**  tab. Then scroll down to **Multimedia** and check the box before **Play sounds in web pages** . Then click **Apply** \> **OK** .

### Fix 5: Clear cache and cookies

 Cache and cookies are some temporary data that help speed up webpage loading. But too much of them may overload Chrome and cause no sound problem. So in order to**clear cache and cookies** :

1. Open Chrome.
2. On the top right, click on**the three vertical dots** button >**More tools** \>**clear browsing data** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1df7b87cca5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. In the drop-down menu, click to select**the time range** for the data cache clearing (Last 7 days in my example). Then click**CLEAR DATA** .

### Fix 6: Disable extensions

 Extensions are features we add to our browser for better user experience. For example, the AdBlock is meant to block ads. But they can also interfere with our Chrome browser and cause the**Chrome no sound** issue. To disable extensions:

1. Open Chrome.
2. At the top right, click on**the three vertical dots** button >**More tools** \>**Extensions** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. Re-launch Chrome and check if sound comes through. If yes, you can try to enable the extensions one by one until you find out the responsible one. But if it doesn’t help with the situation, you might want to turn on the extensions and move on to**Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7: Update Adobe Flash Player

 This problem may also occur if the Adobe Flash Player plug in on Chrome is outdated or faulty. So you can update**Adobe Flash Player** to see if this is the case.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Open Chrome and visit **chrome://components/** to check for update.
2. Under**Adobe Flash Player** , click**Check for update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1dfb5ac965f.jpg)
3. Check the status:

* If it says **Status – Component not updated**  , then go to **[Adobe Flash Player](https://flash.2144.com/)** [](https://flash.2144.com/)  to  download & install the latest version of your   **Adobe flash player**  .
* If it says otherwise, then move on to**Fix 8** .
* Re-open Chrome and check if sound comes through. If the problem still lingers on, proceed with**Fix 8** .

### Fix 8: Reinstall Chrome

 If all else fails, then we might have to reinstall Chrome to give the browser a clean slate and hopefully solve the problem:

 Note: reinstalling your Chrome will erase all browser settings and data.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **appwiz.cpl**  into the box and click **OK** .

2. Locate and right-click on Chrome, then click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b1e14cb32cd8.jpg)
3. Download and install Chrome from another web browser or Windows store.
4. Try sound on the re-installed Chrome and see if the**Chrome no sound** problem has been fixed.
