### Fix 2 – Set your microphone as the default device

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**control** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy-settings-2-1.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy-settings-1-2.jpg)

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 Faulty or outdated device drivers can lead to various gaming issues. If you don’t remember the last time you update your drivers, definitely do it now, as this could keep your audio devices in tip-top condition and very well tackle the Sea of Theives voice chat not working issue.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update audio driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audio-driver-update-de.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Normally the driver update could fix most device glitches. But if the problem persists, try the next method below.

### Fix 5 – Restart Windows audio service

 If the Windows audio service isn’t running properly, sound problem is likely to occur. To fix it, you need to restart the audio service. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run command. Then type**services.msc** in the field and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/audio-service-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**Windows Audio** and select**Restart** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 6 – Check the in-game audio settings

 If everything in the PC sound settings is good to go, make sure to turn on your voice chat in the in-game settings. You can take these steps to check:

1. While in-game, press the**Esc key** on your keyboard and select**My Crew** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-1.jpg)
2. On the right pane, make sure**you don’t mute all other crews voice chat** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-2.jpg)
3. Exit the Window and open the**Settings** menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-3.jpg)
4. Select**Audio Settings** from the left pane. Then, make sure the**Crew Chat Output** is set to the correct device and**Push To Talk is turned on** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now relaunch Sea of Thieves to test. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one below.

1. Open your browser and go to **[account.xbox.com](http://account.xbox.com/)**  . Then, log into your account.
2. Click your**user name** at the upper right corner and select**Xbox settings** .

 After you’ve made those tweaks, launch SoT again to test whether you can talk to your crews. If not, try the last fix.

### Fix 8 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 According to some players, Sea of Thieves voice chat won’t work when their antivirus is enabled. The anti-virus software aims to protect your PC from potential threats but sometimes it can block certain features of other apps or games. To see if that’s the cause, turn off the antivirus and relaunch your game. If the problem gets fixed,**add SoT into the exception list** so that you can use both without conflicts.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
