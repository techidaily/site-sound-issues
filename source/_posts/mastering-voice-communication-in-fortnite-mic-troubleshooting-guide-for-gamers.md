 Note: The screenshots below have been mostly taken from a Windows 10 operating system. If you are using Windows 11, please be aware that the visual appearance of your screen may vary slightly, but the steps to perform the task remain consistent.

### Fix 1: Perform basic troubleshooting

 If you’re having trouble hearing your friends using in-game voice chat when playing Destiny 2, you should check the following first:

1. **Check your speaker and headphone connections** for loose cords or cables. Make sure all cords and cables are plugged in.
2. **Try unplugging and re-plugging** your headphones or speaker.
3. If your device comes with a**mic switch** , make sure it’s**turned on** .
4. Xbox players will need to use an**Xbox Certified headset** to successfully connect and participate in voice chat.

 After confirming that your audio device is not the problem, go ahead with the fixes below.

### Fix 2: Check the Voice Chat settings

 Some players found that the voice chat setting seems to carry over from Steam to console clients. This means that if you have ever logged into the game through Steam and disabled voice chat, then you may encounter the issue of in-game voice chat not working on your console. To fix this problem, you may have to log into the game through Steam and re-enable voice chat in settings. Here’s how:

1. Log into Destiny 2 through Steam.
2. Open**Settings** menu, then select**SOUND** and turn on**Voice Chat** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/turn-on-voice-chat.jpg)
3. Close the game on PC, and then relaunch it on your console.

Now check if voice chat functions properly.

 If this method doesn’t solve your problem, simply continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Check your Stadia or Windows 10 Privacy Settings

 If you play Destiny 2 on Stadia or Windows 10, make sure your privacy settings are configured properly to allow the game to access your microphone. Here’s how:

#### Stadia

1. Navigate to Stadia**Settings** .
2. Select**Privacy** .
3. Ensure that “**Who can send you voice chat and party invites** ” is not set to Private.

2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
3. Type**ms-settings:privacy-microphone** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/win11-ms-settings-privacy-microphone.jpg)
4. Under**Allow apps to access your microphone** , make sure the toggle is set to**ON** . If not, you can click the**Change** button above to turn it on.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/allow-apps-to-access-your-microphone.jpg)
5. Scroll down the list of apps below that toggle to find**Destiny 2** . Make sure it is also toggled to**ON** .

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The voice chat not working issue could indicate that you’re using a faulty or outdated audio driver. If you can’t remember the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now as this might solve your problem right away.

 There are mainly 2 ways to update your audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 6: Check your sound settings (PC)

 If your device is muted or disabled by mistake, you may encounter the issue of Destiny 2 voice chat not working. To see if that’s the case, you need to check the sound settings on your computer. Besides, make sure your microphone is listed as the default device. Here’s how:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**Speakers** icon and select**Open Volume mixer** .

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/services.msc_.jpg)

### Fix 8: Disable any VPNs

 The Destiny 2 in-game voice chat not working issue could also be caused by the VPN you’re using. To see if that’s the case, you can temporarily disable your VPN and test if the in-game chat goes back to normal.

 If it works, then you may have to avoid using any VPNs while playing Destiny 2 or try contacting your VPN support team for help.
