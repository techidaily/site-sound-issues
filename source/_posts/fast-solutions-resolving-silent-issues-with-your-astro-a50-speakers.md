##  Method 1: Make sure your computer sound is going through your sound card

 To ensure your Stereo Mix works well, all your audio output has to go through your sound card so that it can record the output. If your sound is sent around the sound card (using HDMI to output video and audio together, for example), your Stereo Mix is unable to work.

 To use Stereo Mix, you should make sure your computer sound is coming from your sound card. Connect your sound card directly to your speakers and set up the proper output. After that, check to see if your Stereo Mix works normally.
