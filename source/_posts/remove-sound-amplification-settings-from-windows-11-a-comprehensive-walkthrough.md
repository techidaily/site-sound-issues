### Fix 1: Make sure you have not muted the sound

 Sometimes you hear no sound coming through Windows Media Player because you’ve muted the sound unknowingly.

To make sure the volume is not muted but audible:

 1) In**Windows Media Player** , move the slider of the volume control bar to at least half way up.
