## **Fix 4: Update your audio driver**

 Your headphones may also stop working if there’s a problem with your audio driver. If you have the know-how you can update your driver manually, but the process can be quite time-consuming and error-prone.**Alternatively, you can rely on** **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   **– a powerful driver updater tool – to manage all the driver updates** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with both the Free and Pro versions of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just two clicks:

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Fix 7: Switch to ChromeOS

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ChromeOSDesktop.jpg)

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
