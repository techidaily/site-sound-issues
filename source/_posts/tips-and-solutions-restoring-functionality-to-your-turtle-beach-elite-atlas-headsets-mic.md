## Why is there a buzzing sound in your headphones?

While frequency interference is also likely to lead to the buzzing sound issue, you can’t ignore the audio output disturbances. Apart from that, the hardware issue can result in the buzzing sound from the headphones. In addition, the software issue, such as driver corruption probably causes the issue.

 Sometimes it’s hard to identify the issue. But you can still try to troubleshoot the problem and fix it by following the solutions below.

### Fix 1: Troubleshoot the hardware problem

 As mentioned above, the hardware issue is one of the possible reasons to cause buzzing sound in speakers, so you should check the hardware problem and fix any hardware issue found.

#### 1\. Check the audio cable and ports

 Check the audio cable and port to see if they work properly. You can switch to another audio cable and port to see if the buzzing sound is disappeared.

#### 2\. Turn the volume control up and down

 While connected, turn the volume up and down to test if the sound works properly.

### Fix 2: Turn off other electronic devices

 One of the possible causes of buzzing sound is electrical interference. It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven, and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1. Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.
2. Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electromagnetic pulse, you should keep your headphones far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 If this fixes the problem, you can turn on electronic devices one by one to check which device causes the interference.

If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 3: Replace your headphones

 If the above fixes don’t work, you should identify the issue is coming from the PC or your headphones.

 Connect a different headset to your computer and check for a buzzing noise. If the issue persists, obviously the issue comes from the PC. But if the buzzing noise disappears, you need to contact the manufacturer’s customer service for help or replace it to a new one.

If the issue is coming from the PC, the next method may help you fix it.
