### Fix 2: Update your audio drivers

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop your audio service from running. You should update your audio drivers to better troubleshoot your problem.

 There are two ways to update your audio drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your audio drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your audio drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1fc67e2400.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to your audio driver to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee.)

4. Check if your computer now plays music properly. If it doesn’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Fix 3, below.

### Fix 3: Reinstall your audio drivers

 If the above steps didn’t work for you, you can also try reinstalling your audio drivers via Device Manager:

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and **R** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type **devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** to access Device Manager.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1f6f812df0.png)
3. Expand the **Sound, video and game controllers** category.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba1f7aec80f7.jpg)
4. For each audio device under that category, right-click on it and select**Uninstall device** . Note: Click**Uninstall** if prompted for confirmation.
