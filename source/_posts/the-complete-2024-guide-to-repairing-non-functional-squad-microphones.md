Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.
* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 The sound settings may sometimes be messed up after a system update and thus you need to configure the proper setup manually.

1. In the search box, type**control** **panel** and select**Control Panel** .
