Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.
