 Now that you’ve set your desired microphone as the default device, disabled other microphones, and also turned up the volume to the max, it should be working fine when you’re playing Beyond The Wire. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 The Beyond The Wire mic-not-working problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update the audio driver to see if it brings your microphone back to life.

 You can download the latest audio driver from the device manufacturers and install it manually. But this process requires some time, patience and computer skills. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-2-4.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
