### Fix 1: Check for hardware issues

1. Try the headphone on other devices and see if it works.

* If yes: then the problem isn’t on your headphone. Move on to**2)** to narrow the problem down.
* If no: then chances are high that your headphone itself is at fault. You might want to contact the manufacturer for repair/replacement.

2) Try your headphone on a different port on your PC and see if it works.

* If yes: then the other port you have your headphone on is at fault.
* If no: then move on to**Fix 2** to further troubleshoot the audio crackling issue.

### **Fix 2: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

 Having **Exclusive Mode**   on means the specific app will take full control while in use so that other apps cannot play audio through the device. But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the **crackling or popping sound** in headphone  problem. To disable **Exclusive Mode** :

 1) On the bottom right of your screen, right-click on**the sound icon** , then click**Sounds** .
