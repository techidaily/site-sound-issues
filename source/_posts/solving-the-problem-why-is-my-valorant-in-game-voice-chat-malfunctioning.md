### Fix 1: Perform basic troubleshooting

 If you’re having trouble hearing your friends using in-game voice chat when playing Destiny 2, you should check the following first:

1. **Check your speaker and headphone connections** for loose cords or cables. Make sure all cords and cables are plugged in.
2. **Try unplugging and re-plugging** your headphones or speaker.
3. If your device comes with a**mic switch** , make sure it’s**turned on** .
4. Xbox players will need to use an**Xbox Certified headset** to successfully connect and participate in voice chat.

 After confirming that your audio device is not the problem, go ahead with the fixes below.

### Fix 2: Check the Voice Chat settings

 Some players found that the voice chat setting seems to carry over from Steam to console clients. This means that if you have ever logged into the game through Steam and disabled voice chat, then you may encounter the issue of in-game voice chat not working on your console. To fix this problem, you may have to log into the game through Steam and re-enable voice chat in settings. Here’s how:

1. Log into Destiny 2 through Steam.
2. Open**Settings** menu, then select**SOUND** and turn on**Voice Chat** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/turn-on-voice-chat.jpg)
3. Close the game on PC, and then relaunch it on your console.

Now check if voice chat functions properly.

 If this method doesn’t solve your problem, simply continue to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Check your Stadia or Windows 10 Privacy Settings

 If you play Destiny 2 on Stadia or Windows 10, make sure your privacy settings are configured properly to allow the game to access your microphone. Here’s how:

#### Stadia

1. Navigate to Stadia**Settings** .
2. Select**Privacy** .
3. Ensure that “**Who can send you voice chat and party invites** ” is not set to Private.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stadia-privacy-settings.jpg)

#### Windows 10

1. If Destiny 2 is open, close the game entirely.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
3. Type**ms-settings:privacy-microphone** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/win11-ms-settings-privacy-microphone.jpg)
4. Under**Allow apps to access your microphone** , make sure the toggle is set to**ON** . If not, you can click the**Change** button above to turn it on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/allow-apps-to-access-your-microphone.jpg)
5. Scroll down the list of apps below that toggle to find**Destiny 2** . Make sure it is also toggled to**ON** .
6. **Relaunch** the game and check if the in-game voice chat is working.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, move on to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The voice chat not working issue could indicate that you’re using a faulty or outdated audio driver. If you can’t remember the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now as this might solve your problem right away.

 There are mainly 2 ways to update your audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/de-scan.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)

If this solution doesn’t work for you, check out the next fix.

### Fix 5: Reset your audio settings (Console)

 Some players reported that they fixed the cross-play voice chat not working issue by resetting their audio settings. You can give it a shot. Here’s how:

**PS4 or PS5:**

 Go to in-game sound settings, then hold the**square** button to reset it to default.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ps4-square.jpg)

**Xbox:**

 Go to in-game sound settings, then select the “**reset to default** ” button in the bottom right.

Now you can check if the voice chat feature works properly in Destiny 2.

If this method still gives you no luck, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 6: Check your sound settings (PC)

 If your device is muted or disabled by mistake, you may encounter the issue of Destiny 2 voice chat not working. To see if that’s the case, you need to check the sound settings on your computer. Besides, make sure your microphone is listed as the default device. Here’s how:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**Speakers** icon and select**Open Volume mixer** .

### Fix 7: Restart Windows Audio Service

 Windows Audio service manages audio devices for Windows-based programs. If this service is stopped, your audio devices will not function properly. To fix the voice chat not working issue, you can try restarting this service. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Then type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/services.msc_.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, scroll down the services list and locate**Windows Audio** . Then right-click on it and select**Restart** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/restart-windows-audio.jpg)
3. Check that your microphone is now working.
4. If your microphone doesn’t work, right-click**Windows Audio** and select**Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/audio-automatic-ok.jpg)

 Once done, restart your computer and launch Destiny 2 to see if this solves the problem.

If the issue remains, try the next fix.

### Fix 8: Disable any VPNs

 The Destiny 2 in-game voice chat not working issue could also be caused by the VPN you’re using. To see if that’s the case, you can temporarily disable your VPN and test if the in-game chat goes back to normal.

 If it works, then you may have to avoid using any VPNs while playing Destiny 2 or try contacting your VPN support team for help.
