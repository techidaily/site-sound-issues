## Why are my speakers buzzing?

 There are many causes for the speakers humming sound issue. One of the common reasons is the electrical ground loop. While frequency interference is also likely to lead to the buzzing sound issue, you can’t ignore the audio output disturbances. Apart from that, the hardware issue can result in the buzzing sound from the speakers, such as your speaker faulty. In addition, the software issue, such as driver corruption probably causes the issue.

 Sometimes it’s hard to identify the issue. But you can still try to troubleshoot the problem and fix it by following the solutions below.

5. [Configure audio settings in computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Troubleshoot the hardware problem

 As mentioned above, the hardware issue is one of the possible reasons to cause buzzing sound in speakers, so you should check the hardware problem and fix any hardware issue found.

#### 1\. Turn the volume control up and down

 while connected, turn the volume up and down to test if the sound works properly.

#### 2\. Check the audio cable and ports

Check the audio cable and port to see if they work properly.

 When the signal cable is disconnected from the ground, an buzzing sound appears from your speaker. Please check your signal input line.

 You can switch to another audio cable and port to see if the buzzing sound is disappeared.

#### 3\. Check the transformer

 The unstable transformer should also arise your attention. If there’s something wrong with the transformer, you can consider change to a better transformer with the same output voltage.

### Fix 2: Break the electrical ground loop

 One of the possible causes for buzzing sound is the electrical ground loop, so you should break the loop to fix the problem.

You can try to power everything through a single AC socket.

 You can remove the cables connecting the receiver or device powering your speakers, and only connect your speakers to have a try.

### Fix 3: Avoid frequency interference

 It’s common to have many devices near together, but the frequency between different devices can be interfered with each other, such as cordless cellphones, microwave oven and Bluetooth speaker. Therefore, you can check these devices to see if it’s where the problem lies in.

1) Turn off those devices, and unplug the power source.

2) Remove these device close to your speaker.

3) Try your speaker again to see if it works properly now.

 In addition, to avoid the electro magnetic pulse, you should keep your speaker far away from strong electrical devices, and wind the wire in the insulation to prevent something like that happening again.

 This should solve your buzzing sound issue. If not, don’t worry. We have other solutions for you.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The missing or outdated audio driver can cause the speaker making buzzing sound. So you should verify that your audio driver has the latest version and update it if it doesn’t.
