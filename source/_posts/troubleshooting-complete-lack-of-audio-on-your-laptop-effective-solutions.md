If so, you may need to replace it with a new one that supports **Bluetooth 4.0** .
2. **Check the battery of your Bluetooth audio device** . Make sure its battery is sufficient enough for the connection.
3. Place your Bluetooth audio device **close to** your PC to ensure a stable connection.
4. Turn off any other nearby Bluetooth devices to **reduce the interference** .

See if Bluetooth audio lags or not. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Reconnect your Bluetooth audio device to your PC

 This is the quickest and easiest fix to try when you run into Bluetooth audio lag issue. Just turn off your Bluetooth audio device and then turn it on to reconnect your Bluetooth audio device to your PC.

 If Bluetooth audio still lags, try removing it first. Then pair it to your PC again. If you don’t know how to pair your Bluetooth audio device to your PC, you can refer to the article: **[ Sony Bluetooth Headphones Pairing \[Step by Step\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 4: Update your Bluetooth driver

 If the Bluetooth driver on your PC is missing or outdated, you may run into Bluetooth audio lag issue. It is a good idea to update your Bluetooth driver to the latest version. By doing that, you can avoid many unexpected Bluetooth problems.

 There are two ways to update your Bluetooth driver: manually or automatically.

**Update your Bluetooth driver manually** – You can update your Bluetooth driver manually **by going to the manufacturer’s website** , and searching for the latest driver for your Bluetooth device. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your PC model and your version of Windows.

**Or**

**Update your Bluetooth driver automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your Bluetooth driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[D](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [river Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
