 Your HyperX cloud Stinger might be accidentally muted or not connected correctly. It’s worth checking the mute settings and the connectors of your headset to make sure they’re seated properly.

1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.
2. Check if all your connections are rightly plugged in, including the extension cable connections. For the microphone, **ensure it’s plugged in all the way and not hanging loosely** .
3. Check the volume knob on the right ear and **make sure the mic is not muted or the volumes are not too low** .

![select the app you're using and turn it on](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/which-app.jpg)
7. Now check if HyperX Cloud Stinger’s microphone is working. If you have granted all the permissions to the microphone but you still can’t be heard, you can try the next fix.

**To allow apps to access your Microphone on a Mac**

1. Choose Apple menu ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/5E3B07C0094622B541F026E3/5E3B07C3094622B541F026EA/en_GB/2f77cc85238452e25cb517130188bf99.png) \>**System Preferences** , click**Sound** , then click**Input** .

 If you can talk to Siri but this app still isn’t working, check the app’s preferences to see if there are separate settings for input devices. But if everything works just fine in other apps, you can try reinstalling this app.

## 3\. Check your microphone settings

 Another common cause of microphone problems is that you may have disabled your headset microphone, or not set it as the default input device. To check if this is the source of the problem, please check these things:

## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.

## 6\. Check your HyperX Cloud Stinger in your game apps

 Sometimes the culprit may not be on your audio or control box settings, but in the game or app, you use instead. Check the audio settings in the game, or in the app, then confirm whether this will make your HyperX Cloud Stinger mic work again.

## 7\. Perform Windows Update
