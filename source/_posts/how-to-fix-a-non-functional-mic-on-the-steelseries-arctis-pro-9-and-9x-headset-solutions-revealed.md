### Fix 1: Set up the microphone correctly

 Before you try the following fixes, please make sure the mute button is not activated.

 Also, the microphone is highly directional, so it must be placed properly to achieve the best sound quality.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 2: Allow access to your microphone

 The first thing you need to make sure of is that your device allows apps to access your microphone. This is especially true if you can’t be heard in any apps.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) In the Windows Search box, type**microphone,** and select**Microphone privacy settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) Please be sure to turn on “**Allow access to the microphone on this device** ” and “**Allow apps to access your microphone** “.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image.png)

 3) Scroll down to allow microphone access for the Microsoft apps and desktop apps.

 Now you can test recording and see if your SteelSeries Arctis Pro mic is working right now. But if not, please move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Set your headset as the default device

 In most cases, when you plug your headset into the computer, it will be set as the default device on the computer. But sometimes it can bump into issues. If your SteelSeries Actis Pro mic is not working, your headset may be disabled or not set as the default device.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and the **R** key at the same time to open the Run box.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) In the Control Panel window, view by**Large icons** , and then select**Sound** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-1.png)

 3) In the Sound windows, select the **Recording**  tab.

 4) Make sure your Actis Pro is**Enabled** (shows a green checkmark) and set it as the**Default Device** . If not, you can right-click it and select**Set as Default Device** and**Set as Default Communication Device** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-5.png)

 In your VoIP application, select Actis Pro Chat Audio as the default audio device.

 5) Select the microphone and click **Properties** .

 6) Click the **Levels**  tab, and drag the slider to a proper volume.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/image-4.png)

 7) Also go to the**Enhancements** tab, and check the box Disable all sound effects.

 8) Click**Apply** \>**OK** .

 Now your SteelSeries Actis Pro should be working, and if you still have problems with the microphone, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Update the headset driver

 The microphone on your SteelSeries Arctis Pro won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated driver. So if the fixes above didn’t work, you should try updating the driver to see if it does the trick.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical, and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the headset to download the latest and correct driver for it.

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SteelSeries-Apex-Pro.jpg)

 You can also click the**Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation. No charges will occur until after your 7-day trial period ends.)

 Once you’ve updated the driver for your SteelSeries Actis Pro, you can restart your computer and check if the microphone is working.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**
