### Fix 4 â€“ Remove other programs for audio control

 If youâ€™ve installed other audio-related programs such as Nahimic, they will possibly conflict with OBS and thus cause the desktop audio not working issue. Many users also reported that Realtek Gaming Software and Razer Synapse will interfere with OBS.

 Try removing the programs that may take control of your audio device and test. If the issue goes away then, you should uninstall those programs to avoid possible audio issues in OBS. If this method doesnâ€™t help, go to the next fix, below.

### Fix 5 â€“ Update your audio driver

 If you constantly bump into audio issues when using OBS, chances are that your audio driver is faulty or outdated. To make sure the audio works as expected when recording with OBS or other applications, you should always keep your audio driver up-to-date.

 You can get the latest compatible sound drivers in two ways:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** â€“ You can update your audio driver manually by going to the sound card manufacturerâ€™s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. But make sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
