### Method 2: Update your audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop the mic from working in Fortnite. You can try **updating your audio driver** to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver —**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your audio driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your audio driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf4e77d496c.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically.  (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)

5. **Relaunch** Fortnite to see if your mic is working now.

4. Now test your voice chat in-game.
