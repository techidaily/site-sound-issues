## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The Windows 11 no sound issue and other audio issues are usually caused by drivers. Outdated drivers or missing drivers are the reason for many PC problems. To fix it, you need to find the latest and compatible driver for your devices.

 You can update the audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website and downloading the correct driver. Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills.
