### Fix 3 – Tweak OBS audio settings

 If you’ve set everything up on PC but still fail to bring back the desktop audio, you should take a look at the audio settings in OBS and make sure to select the proper devices.

**1)** Launch OBS.

**2)** Click**File** at the upper left corner and click**Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-1-8.jpg)

**3)** Click**Audio** on the left pane. Then, select**Stereo** next to Channels.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-3-1.jpg)

**4)** Scroll to Global Audio Devices and make sure you’ve selected the actual device you’re using for**Desktop Audio** and**Mic/Auxiliary Audio** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mIv00M.jpg)

 Now that you’ve made the tweaks, see if OBS desktop audio works the right way. If the no audio issue persists, keep reading to find out more solutions.

### Fix 4 – Remove other programs for audio control

 If you’ve installed other audio-related programs such as Nahimic, they will possibly conflict with OBS and thus cause the desktop audio not working issue. Many users also reported that Realtek Gaming Software and Razer Synapse will interfere with OBS.

 Try removing the programs that may take control of your audio device and test. If the issue goes away then, you should uninstall those programs to avoid possible audio issues in OBS. If this method doesn’t help, go to the next fix, below.

### Fix 5 – Update your audio driver

 If you constantly bump into audio issues when using OBS, chances are that your audio driver is faulty or outdated. To make sure the audio works as expected when recording with OBS or other applications, you should always keep your audio driver up-to-date.

 You can get the latest compatible sound drivers in two ways:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the sound card manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. But make sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-12.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your computer and check if the driver update helps your case. If not, there is the last method to try.
