### Fix 1: Make sure your device is working

 Before you start, you need to make sure the output device (speaker/headphone) is working without any issues.

<a href="https://martinic.evyy.net/c/5597632/1422856/4482" target="_top" id="1422856"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1422856" border="0" alt="" width="580" height="309"/></a>

 First you need to make sure the device is**connected to the right port** of your PC. You can also check by testing it on another computer or device (e.g. your phone). Note that some headphones come with**switches** that need to be turned on manually.

If the output device works as expected, simply continue to the next step.

### Fix 2: Run the troubleshooter

 Windows has a**built-in troubleshooter** that fixes basic issues automatically. You can run the troubleshooter and see if it’s just the wrong setting.

1. On the taskbar, click the search icon and type**troubleshooting** . Select**Troubleshoot settings** .

3. Select**Playing Audio** . Then follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 There’re multiple reports suggesting that the no sound issue is caused by an**outdated or incompatible audio driver** . Some drivers might not work properly if you upgrade from Windows 10\. For Windows 11 to function properly, you need to make sure you have the latest correct audio driver.

 You can update the audio driver manually, by visiting the motherboard manufacturer’s website, downloading the latest correct installer and installing step by step. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan, repair and update drivers automatically.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-update-all-realtek-audio.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating all the drivers, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.

 If the latest drivers can’t fix the problem, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 5: Check for the latest system updates

 Windows 11 is new and is under active development. So it’s possible the cure to your problem lies in the latest patch. To get it, you can scan for updates manually and Windows will install them automatically.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control update** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/run-control-update-1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then check for available updates. (Or click Restart now if it prompts “Restart required”)

### Fix 6: Scan and pair Windows

 In the worst case, you’re dealing with a system issue. It could mean that some critical files are**corrupted or missing** from your system, and it could also mean that some settings are**misconfigured** . Either way, if you don’t want a clean reinstall, you can**run a scan** and find out what went wrong.

 For that job we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a powerful system repair tool that scans and fixes system issues without damaging personal data.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .

 Fortect comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee. If you’re not satisfied with Fortect, you can contact <support@fortect.com> for a full refund.

### Fix 7: Reset Windows

 If the sound issues only appear after upgrading from Windows 10, you might need to do a**clean reinstall** —we always recommend a clean reinstall instead of direct upgrade so as to avoid strange issues.

 You can revert the system to factory default settings with the Windows built-in feature:

 Before you reset Windows, make sure to**back up** the files you need to a safe storage.

1. On your taskbar, click the search icon and type**reset** . Click**Reset this PC** .
