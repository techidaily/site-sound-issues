 Now you should be able to use the Onikuma headset mic with whatever applications. But if the problem persists, try the next fix below.

### Fix 3 – Set your Onikuma mic as the default device

 If there are multiple microphone inputs on your computer, the Onikuma headset mic might not be used properly until you set it as the default device. Here’s how:

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sound-settings-1-3.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by and click**Sound** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-2-1.jpg)
3. Select the**Recording** tab. Then right-click your Onikuma headset mic and click**Enable** (if it’s not) and click**Set as Default Device** .  
 If you don’t see it listed, right-click any blank space and tick**Show Disabled Devices** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sound-settings-0-1.jpg)
4. Right-click the microphone again and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sound-settings-3-1.jpg)
5. On the**Levels** tab, check whether the microphone is muted. If yes, click the**speaker icon** to unmute it and**drag the volume slider to the max** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-8-1.jpg)

 In some cases, Onikuma headset mic not working only occurs in specific applications. If so, you should**check the application settings** and manually**set the Onikuma headset as your preferred audio device** .

 If this method doesn’t help either, move on to the next fix to check your audio driver.

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, your Onikuma headset may constantly act up and the mic isn’t working. To keep your gaming headset up and running at all times, you should update the audio driver on a regular basis.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 You can find the most recent correct driver on the website of your headset or computer manufacturer. Then download the one that is compatible with your Windows version.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
