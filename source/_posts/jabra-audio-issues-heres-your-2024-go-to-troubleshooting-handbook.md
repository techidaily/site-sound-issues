 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your computer is corrupted, faulty or outdated, a headset may not connect to the PC or work correctly. You may find the mic is malfunctioning or there’s no sound at all. In this case, you should run a scan and**install the latest correct audio driver** .

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .
