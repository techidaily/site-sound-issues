### Fix 1:**Check your audio input device**

 There’re many reasons for microphone problems, but the first thing you should do when troubleshooting is to**check the physical connections** . Make sure the cables of your microphone are securely plugged into the**correct audio jack** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/audio-ports.jpg)

 Also check if your**cable** is damaged. If your microphone or headset has a**mute switch** , make sure it’s unmuted. You can also try plugging in the cable again to see if it gives you any luck, or you can use your cellphone or another computer for audio testing.

 If there’s nothing wrong with your input device, check out the next method.

## Fix 2: Configure your system microphone settings

 Normally when you plugged in your microphone, Windows will set it as the default recording device. But that’s not always the case. Sometimes you’ll need to configure this setting manually.

You can use these steps to check:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type or paste**ms-settings:sound** and click**OK** .

2. Under the**Input** section, make sure your input device is set to the desired one. Then click**Device properties and test microphone** .

 If this method doesn’t tackle your problem, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 3:**Check your in-game settings**

Here’re the steps:

1. Open the**Blizzard client** . On the top left corner, click the**Blizzard icon** and select**Settings** .

3. Launch WoW. Open game settings and select**Voice Chat** .
4. Configure**Output Device** and**Microphone Device** to**System Default** . Then test your microphone. If your mic is working now, click**Okay** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wow-in-game-voice-chat.jpg)

 If configuring in-game settings doesn’t give you any luck, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 4:**Update your audio driver**

 The voice chat issue could occur when you’re using a**faulty or outdated audio driver** . You should be sure that you’re using the latest audio driver, especially when you’ve spend top dollar for your peripherals, which often ship with edgy features that need to be unlocked by additional drivers.

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting each manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
