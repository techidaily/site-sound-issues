### Fix 2: Update your audio drivers

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop your audio service from running. You should update your audio drivers to better troubleshoot your problem.

 There are two ways to update your audio drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Update your audio drivers manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

OR

**Update your audio drivers automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update** button next to your audio driver to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).
