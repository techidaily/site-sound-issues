 Now that your Logitech Pro X microphone is set as default and the volume is turned up, test the issue again. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your headset from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.
