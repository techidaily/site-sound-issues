 To troubleshoot the temporary device glitches, you could try a few common workarounds:

* **Try a different USB port** just in case the previous port you use is somehow broken or it can not provide enough power to your headset.

 If you go through the steps above but the problem persists, move on to the more complicated fixes below.

2. On the Windows Settings menu, select**Privacy** .

### Fix 4 – Check the sound settings

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then, type**control** in the text field and click**OK** .
