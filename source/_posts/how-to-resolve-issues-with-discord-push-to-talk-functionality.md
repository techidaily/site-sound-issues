 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**Manual driver update:** You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for both your audio card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only the driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Automatic driver update:** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact audio card, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install them correctly:
