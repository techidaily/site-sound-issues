 5) See if your sound is back. If you still cannot get your sound back, choose Cancel here, and then repeat 2) and 3) with your other default device and have a try again.

## 3: Update sound driver

 If no good signs are shown after the first two methods, it’s likely that you’re using the wrong driver altogether.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your sound or audio card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your audio card, and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows 10\.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do so automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :
