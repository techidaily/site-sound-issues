## Fix 1: Check the hardware faulty

 If your computer suddenly has a no sound issue, there is likely a problem with the hardware issue. You can troubleshoot by the following tips:

#### 1\. Check the speaker on your computer

 Simply take a look at the**speaker** on your computer and see whether anything is covering the speaker, which could cause no sound on your computer. Make sure**no dust or cloth** can cover the sound on your computer.

#### 2\. Check the headphone jack

 You can first check the headphone jack. **Look inside the headphone jack to see if there is any obstacle** that may stop the headphones from working properly.

 If there is,**clean the jacks with a cotton swab or soft brush** .**Push it** into the jack and**swirl it** around a little bit to get the dust and lint out.

#### 3\. Check the microphone or headphone

 If your computer is connecting to a headphone, you can also check your headphones to make sure that the devices are working normally.

 You can try to disconnect the headphones and see if there is sound. If yes, it seems to be your headphone issue, so you can replace it with a normal headphone.

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…
