 7\. Reboot your PC for the change to take effect.  
  
**Secondly, download and install new audio driver**
  
 Generally, audio driver can be downloaded from audio card manufacturer’s website and PC manufacturer’s website. **But in this case, you need to download the driver from the PC manufacturer’s website, because the audio driver released by PC manufacturer will be customized with Dolby components** .
  
 Before you get started to download drivers, ensure that you know the PC model name and the specific operating system that your PC is running. After updating the driver, restart your computer then the problem should resolve.
