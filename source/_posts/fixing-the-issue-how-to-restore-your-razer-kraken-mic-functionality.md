## HyperX Cloud Alpha Mic Not Working? Here's How to Restore Functionality

As a direct follow-up to Cloud II, HyperX Cloud Alpha adds a whole bunch of new and exciting things, and it sounds neutral, dynamic, and clean. If you’re having problems with the HyperX Cloud Alpha microphone, don’t worry. Many users are reporting the same issue, and it can be fixed quickly and easily.

* [2. Troubleshoot the HyperX headset microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

* [4. Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [5. Change your microphone settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 1\. Check the connections

 Since HyperX Cloud Alpha comes with a detachable microphone, so it’s important to firmly insert the detachable cable plug to ensure full connectivity (you really need to push it into the headset). Also, make sure not to mute the Mic, and increase the volume to the max level. This is the final fix for many users.

 If you’re using HyperX Cloud Alpha on Xbox One, you’ll need an adapter. Make sure the Mute button is not active, and use the buttons on the adapter to adjust the sound and microphone volume. Then go to**Settings** , and go to**Audio** to make sure the microphone is on. (The Cloud Alpha S is only compatible with PC and PS4.)

## 5\. Change your microphone settings

 Normally, Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default input device once your headphone is plugged into. But sometimes you’ll need to set it as the default device manually:

1. Right-click on the sound icon in the lower-right corner of your desktop, and select **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sounds.jpg)
2. Go to the **Recording** tab, and make sure your **Headset Microphone** is set as the default device. If not, select your headphone and click **Set Default** .

3. Also, make sure it displays your headphone name correctly and shows strong signals. If your headphone is shown as something else, there’s something wrong with your mic settings, so you should re-connect your headset.

4. If the display name and signal is normal, right-click **Headset Microphone** and click **Properties** .
