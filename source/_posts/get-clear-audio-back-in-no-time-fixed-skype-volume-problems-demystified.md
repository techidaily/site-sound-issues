## Fix 1: Troubleshoot the connection

 First things first. Before trying anything more complicated, you need to do some basic troubleshooting steps:

* Check if you muted your speaker or headset.
* Reconnect your audio device (e.g. the speaker or headset) to your PC and make sure everything is connected properly.
* Check if you muted the sound in the audio settings of the game.

 If you’re pretty sure that everything is OK, but there’s still no sound in the game, don’t worry. Let’s move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your PC is missing, corrupted or outdated, it may cause the no sound issue in It Takes Two. If you haven’t updated your audio driver for a long time, you should update the audio driver.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
