 If you’ve plugged the external sound device into the computer,_**ensure they are recognized by your computer**_ .  
**How to check** : In the system tray, if you see a red x with circle icon the speaker icon, it indicates the external sound device (for example, your speakers or your microphone) is not connected to the computer. In this case, unplug the device then replug it. After that, if the issue is still there, refer the steps in**Solution 2** to check if the device is disabled.

 Solution 5: Update the audio driver

 If the installed audio driver is outdated, it may not support the Audacity record feature. To fix the error, you can try to update the audio driver.  
  
 You can update the audio driver manually. Just go to your PC manufacturer’s website or the sound card manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest audio driver. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
  
 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):  
  
 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.  
  
 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/img_5ab8d83603b51.png)
