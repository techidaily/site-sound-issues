 Now that everything is set up in the right way, test your microphone in Microsoft Team. If it still fails to work, check out the next fix.

2. Click the**settings icon** at the upper right corner and click**Device Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1-1.jpg)

### Fix 4 â€“ Update your audio driver

 The Microsoft Teams mic not working issue may indicate problems with your audio driver. To ensure the microphone work smoothly when youâ€™re on an online class or meeting, you should always keep the audio driver upâ€“to-date. Here are two ways for you to update the audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 â€“ Download and install the driver manually

 To update the driver manually, you can visit the PC or the headset manufacturerâ€™s website and search for the most recent driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit).

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the right driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

#### Option 2 â€“ Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the drivers for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1-3.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but itâ€™s partly manual.

### Fix 5 â€“ Reinstall Microsoft Teams

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run command. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-1-2.jpg)
2. Right-click**Microsoft Teams** and click**Uninstall** .

3. Download the newest version of Microsoft Team from its **[official website](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-teams%2Fgroup-chat-software&id=drivereasy-en-134633)**  .

Now your microphone should be working perfectly with Microsoft Teams.
