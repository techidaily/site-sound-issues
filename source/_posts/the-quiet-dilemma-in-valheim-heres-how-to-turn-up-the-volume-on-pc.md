## 2\. Check your audio settings

 The easy steps you can take in fixing your audio output issue is by making sure your audio device is set to your primary output device.

To make sure your audio device is correctly set, take these steps:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select **Open Sound settings** .

## 3\. Update your sound driver

 Whenever you run into any sound issues, one of the most possible causes is that you’re using a faulted or outdated sound driver. Driver updates bring new features and would fix known bugs which lead to the malfunctions of your devices. Therefore, if you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now as it may fix your issue immediately.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your sound driver

 This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. If you know the specifications of your PC, you can try to update your audio driver manually.

 You can do this by visiting the website of your motherboard manufacturer, then search for your exact model. When you find your motherboard, go to its support page and download the driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system.

### Option 2: Automatically update your sound driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
