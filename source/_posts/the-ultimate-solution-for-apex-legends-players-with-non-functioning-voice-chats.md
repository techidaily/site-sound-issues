### Fix 3: Make sure your microphone is set as default in Windows

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default device every time it’s plugged into. But that’s not always the case and sometimes you’ll have to manually set it as default.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20To%20Fix%20Fortnite%20Sound%20Not%20Working%20-%20https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-fortnite-sound-not-working-on-pc/) **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and R at the same time, then type **ms-settings:sound** and press **Enter** to open Control Panel.

 4) In **Sound** settings, scroll down to the**Input** section, and in**Choose your input device** , make sure the microphone you are actively using is selected. Then,**test your microphone** by speaking into your mic to see if it ‘hears’ anything. If yes, it means you have configured the microphone properly.
