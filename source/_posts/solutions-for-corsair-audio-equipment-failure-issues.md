If you’re on Windows 10 or Windows 7, and you’re hearing a popping sound coming out from your speaker and/or your headphones, you’re not alone. We’ve received reports from many Windows users reporting it. But no worries, you can get it fixed.

## **How do I fix it?**

## **3\. DPC Latency**

 In some cases, high latency could be the cause of your static audio among many other audio problems. Luckily, there’s a handy tool called **DPC Latency Checker** . It helps monitor your PC performance and tells you what’s causing the latency.

 1) Download[**DPC Latency Checker**](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) and click the download file to open it.

 2) If you’re seeing green bars as shown in the screenshot below, and nothing in the top red section, your PC is in a good state. Move on to the next step below.

 Try disabling your device drivers from Device Manager as shown in **[Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  one by one.
