 **Step 1: First Things First**
  
 1) Plug out the microphone from the original jack on your PC and then plug it back on again. Make sure that you plug your microphone in to the right port. See if your microphone works in this way.
  
 2) Try use the same microphone on another computer if you have one. If not, you can use it on your friend’s PC to have a test. If sound comes out right, that means your microphone is to blame. You might need to consider getting a new microphone.
