### **Fix 1: Disable Exclusive Mode and change the sound format**

 Having**Exclusive Mode** on means the specific app will take full control while in use so that other apps cannot play audio through the device. But the feature can sometimes interfere with the audio driver, hence the**crackles in speakers** problem. To disable**Exclusive Mode** :

1. On your keyboard, press   **the Windows logo key**  and type**audio** , then click**Manage audio devices** .

2. Right-click on**speakers** and click**Properties** .

3. Click the**Advanced** tab, un-check**the box** before **Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device** . Then click**Apply** \>**OK** .

4. Play some audio on your laptop to see if it fixes the sound problem. If not, continue with**5)** to**change the audio format** .
5. Still in the**Advanced** tab, select **16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)** . Then click **Apply** \>**OK** .
