## How to fix volume control not working

### Solution 1 – Update the sound card driver

 Updating the sound card driver should always be your go-to option when you suspect something’s wrong with your sound card.  You can either update the sound card driver manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product to automatically update the driver for you.

#### Option 1 – Use Windows Update to manually update the sound card driver

1. On the Windows desktop, click on the**Start** button and select**Device Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8386fc8d4b0.png)
2. Open the**Sound, video and game controllers** entry.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8387b285c81.jpg)
3. For each device under the entry,**right-click** on them one by one and select**Update driver** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8388110b553.png)
4. Click on**Search automatically for updated driver software** . Then Windows will search online for the correct driver for your sound card.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83888a27eb0.png)  
 Note: If you’re told that**The best drivers for your device are already installed** , because sometimes Microsoft might not be able to detect the update for some reasons, then you can try option 2 below to let**Driver Easy** automatically update the sound card driver for you.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Repeat step 3 and 4 with the other device(s) in the entry.

#### Option 2 – Use Driver Easy to automatically update the sound card driver

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now** button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b837d8fc5e81.jpg)

 After updating the driver for your sound card, you can restart your computer and test the volume by playing a song. If the problem persists, continue with the troubleshooting steps in the next sections.

### Solution 2 – Reinstall the sound card driver

 If updating the sound card driver doesn’t work, try reinstalling the driver:

1. In**Device Manager** , click on the**Sound, video and game controllers** directory.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8387b285c81.jpg)
2. For each device listed in the directory,**right-click** on them one by one and select**Uninstall device** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b839c0a34d6c.png)
3. Click on**Uninstall** to remove the driver.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Restart your PC, and Windows will reinstall the drivers automatically. Once the drivers are reinstalled, the problems with the volume control should be resolved.

### Solution 3 – Reset audio service

 Resetting the**Windows Audio properties** in Services does the trick for some users. You may follow the steps below to give it a shot:

1. Type**services** in the Windows search box and select**Services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83d5755b9b6.jpg)

4. Then, click on**Stop** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b839035da0da.jpg)
5. Click on**Start** . And then click on**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b8390914ad0e.jpg)
6. Restart your PC to see if the problem is resolved. If not, you can try the next solution.

### Solution 4 – Run an SFC scan

 It could be possible that your files might get corrupted and prevent the volume control form working properly. If so, you can fix the problem by running an SFC scan.

**System File Checker** will inspect all of the important Windows files on your PC. If the Checker finds an issue with any of these protected files, it will replace it.

1. In the Windows search box, type **cmd**
2. From the results, **right-click**  on **Command Prompt**  and select   **Run as administrator.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83cc25ace4b.jpg)
3. Click **Yes**  at the **User Account Control** prompt.

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135396/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83cc8f3b036.jpg)
4. Once Command Prompt is open, type the **sfc /scannow**  command and press **Enter.**  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087253/19272" target="_top" id="2087253">
  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087253" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087253/19272" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Note:**  There’s a space between **sfc**  and **/scannow** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7e9e344ae71.jpg)  
The scan can take 10-15 minutes, so don’t interrupt it.
5. After the SFC scan is finished, your files will be repaired and the volume control should be working properly.

### Solution 5 – **Use Microsoft security scanner to scan your computer**

 In case the audio issues in your PC are caused by malware, you can use the**Microsoft Safety Scanner** tool to find and remove malware from your Windows computer.  Simply go to[**http://safety.live.com**](http://safety.live.com) to download the tool and run a scan to find malware and try to reverse changes made by identified threats.

### Solution 6 – **Place your computer in Safe Mode**

 If all the above methods aren’t successful for you, we recommend placing your computer in Safe Mode to see if everything(especially the volume control) functions properly there to verify the cause of the volume control not working problem.

**Safe mode** is a diagnostic mode of a computer operating system, which loads only essential processes and drivers. It’s sometimes necessary to enter Safe Mode in order to troubleshoot problems on your PC.

 Here are the steps of how to enter Safe Mode with Internet to troubleshoot the problem.

1. On your keyboard, press the   **Windows![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b7b8ac86a6f5.png)**  key  and **R**  key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **msconfig**  and click   **OK.**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83ccc168f4b.png)
3. At the top of the **System Configuration**  window, click on the **Boot**  tab, **check**  the box next to **Safe boot** , select **Network**  and click   **OK.**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83ccdde7859.jpg)  
**Note:** If you want to start Windows in**Normal Mode** , ensure the**Safe boot** box is**unchecked** .

4. Save any open files and close all programs, and click   **Restart.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83cd006284c.png)
5. Once in Safe Mode, try adjusting the system volume.  
   * If the volume control is working, you can download  an antivirus and run a scan in Safe Mode, then restart your PC normally to see if the problem’s resolved.  
   * If the volume control doesn’t work as expected, you can restart you PC normally and try the last solution below.

### Solution 7 – **Run a task via Task Manager**

If the issue still persists, we suggest you to try the below troubleshooting steps and check:

1. Press **CTRL+Shift+ESC** on the keyboard to access **Task manager** .
2. Click on the **File**  tab and select**Run new task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83a86374e1d.png)
3. Type**Powershell** , check**Create this task with administrative privileges** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b83a93c0faea.png)
4. Type the following command in the pop-up window, and press**Enter** :  
 **$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + ‘\\AppxManifest.xml’; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest**
5. Close the Powershell window.
6. Reboot your computer.

 That’s it.  Hopefully this post helps fix the volume control not working issue. If you have any questions, feel free to add a comment below.
