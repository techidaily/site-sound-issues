The Corsair HS35 mic is a good-value product but it might be frustrating when it suddenly stops working sometimes. If you’re having the same issue, we have a few solutions that might work for you!

## Try these fixes

 **Before trying the fixes below, you should have a simple check first:**
**–** Make sure your headset is not muted on the left earcup.
 **–** Replug the mic (removable) on your Corsair HS35 headset.  
**–** Check if your device’s ports are clogged by dust or obstacles.  
**–** If you’re using a Desktop PC, try both the front and rear 3.5mm jacks.

 You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the fix that works.

## Fix 1 – Allow access to your microphone on your PC

 If your Corsair HS35 is not activated in the Window settings, your PC will lack the access to your microphone and so the mic just won’t start to work at all. Follow these steps to allow access to your microphone:

1. Press the**Windows + I** keys to open Windows settings, then select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/setting-Privacy.jpg)
2. Select**Microphone** on the left panel, then click the**Change** button to see if the toggle is**On** in the pop-up menu. If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mic-setting-1.jpg)
3. Check to see if the toggle in the**Allow apps to access your microphone** section is turned**On** . If it isn’t, change the toggle to On.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mic-setting-2-1.jpg)

 Try your mic to see if it’s working now. If it isn’t, move on to the next fix.

## Fix 2 – Check the audio settings

 Sometimes your computer’s audio settings might be messed up because of frequent or erroneous operations. In this case, you should try the steps below to configure the audio settings.

1. Right-click the**volume icon** on the task bar and then select**Sounds** from the mune that appears.

 If this fix doesn’t give you the luck, try the next below to update your audio drives.

## Fix 3 – Update your audio driver

 The mic not working problem may also occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. Therefore you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 You can manually install the most recent driver from your PC manufacturer’s official website or from the **[Corsair download page](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads)**  . But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  can do it for you.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DE-5.7.2-SCAN.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of that driver (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DE-audio-card-driver.jpg)
4. After updating your audio driver, restart your PC for the trick to take effect.

## Fix 5 – Use a USB audio card

 If your computer’s sound card is defective or if your laptop/desktop system has a faulty 3.5mm audio port, the Corsair HS35 mic may not be able to work properly. If that is the case, you might think about using a USB Audio Card, which is an external sound device that can **bypass problems in your built-in sound card and regain the audio function for you** .

## Fix 6 – Seek technical support or after-sales service

 If you’ve tried all of the above fixes and still can’t get your mic boom to function, the issue could be with your headset rather than your computer.**You can try connecting your headset to another PC** ; if it’s still not working, there may be an issue with your Corsair Mic. In this situation, you should **[contact Corsair for support](https://help.corsair.com/hc/en-us)**  or have your headset serviced.
