## Trouble with Talking in Black Ops: Cold War? Here's How to Get Your Voice Chat Working Again

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/black-ops-cold-war-featured.jpg)

 When you’re about to enjoy the fight in Black Ops Cold War with your buddies, the last thing you want to know is that the voice chat stops working. Many gamers are reporting this**voice chat issue** with the new COD title. So here we have some fixes that worked for many veterans, try them and dominate the field with your amigos.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try all of them. Just work your way down until you find a fix that works for you.

1. [**Check the connection of your audio device**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. **[Disable your peripherals](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Change your default recording device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Change the in-game audio settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check the connection of your audio device

 When your voice chat stops working, the first thing you want to do is check your connection. You need to **make sure the device cable is not broken or worn out, and is securely plugged into the correct headphone jack of your PC** . Or you can simply do a replug and see how it goes. If you’re using a headset with a switch, make sure you’ve turned on the mic.

If the connection is fine, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Disable your peripherals

 In some cases, your game chat won’t work[**because your controller is conflicting with your mic**](https://www.reddit.com/r/blackopscoldwar/comments/jtcnob/voice%5Fchat%5Fnot%5Fworking/) . This is a weird but possible situation. So before entering Black Ops Cold War, make sure you’ve disabled your peripherals, especially those with a headphone jack.

 If you’re not using any peripherals, simply move on to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Change your default recording device

 Normally, Windows will automatically set your audio device as the system default once they’re plugged in. But that’s not always the case. Sometimes you’ll need to**set your device as the default one manually** . You can follow the instructions below to make sure your settings are correct.

#### Set up your mic correctly on Windows

First you need to check the default audio device on your system:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo button and the r button) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **ms-settings:sound** and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-ms-settings-sound.jpg)
2. Under the**Input** section, make sure your input device is set to your desired one. Then click**Device properties and test microphone** .

4. Click **Start test** and tap or speak to your microphone. Then click **Stop test** . If you’re prompted **The highest value we saw was xx (xx > 0) percent** , it means your microphone has been set up correctly.

#### Set up your mic correctly in the Battle.net client

Next, you need to check the voice chat settings in the Battle.net client:

1. Open your **Battle.net**  client.
2. At the top left corner, click the **BLIZZARD**  icon and select **Settings**  from the drop-down menu.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/battle-net-settings-1.jpg)
3. On the menu to your left, select **Voice Chat** . Set **OUTPUT DEVICE** and **INPUT DEVICE** to **System Default Device** . Then click **Done** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blizzard-voice-chat.jpg)

Now launch Black Ops Cold War and see if you can talk to others.

 If your mic still doesn’t work in the game, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 The voice chat not working issue could indicate that you’re using**a faulty or outdated audio driver** . If you don’t remember the last time you updated any drivers, definitely do it now as it fix your problem right away.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can spend some time to update your audio driver manually.

 First you need to visit your device manufacturer’s website and search for your model. Next, download the latest correct driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Finally, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your audio driver, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Black Ops Cold War.

 If updating the audio driver doesn’t work for you, simply continue to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Change the in-game audio settings

 For your voice chat to work correctly, you also need to make sure the in-game audio settings are properly set up. You can follow these steps to check:

1. Launch Black Ops Cold War. Open**Settings** and navigate to the**AUDIO** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-audio-settings.jpg)
2. Be sure to set both**Speakers/Headphones Voice Chat Device** and**Microphone Device** to**Default Communication Device** . Set**Microphone Activation Mode** to**Open Mic** . Then increase the value of**Open Microphone Sensitivity** to over 50.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/bocw-ingame-voice-settings.jpg)

 Now you can restart Black Ops Cold War and check if the voice chat is working.

 If changing game settings doesn’t help, you can try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Install all Windows updates

 In addition to drivers, you also need to**keep your system up to date** . That means you need to make sure you’ve installed all the available system updates, which often addresses compatibility issues and helps you avoid many strange errors.

Here’s a quick guide for that:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will download and install the available updates. Wait for the process to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 After installing all the system updates, do a reboot and check if you can talk in Black Ops Cold War now.
