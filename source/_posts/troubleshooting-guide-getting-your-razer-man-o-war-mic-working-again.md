1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.

1. Click the**Start** menu button, and select the**Settings** icon.  
![Click the Start button](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-start.jpg)
2. Select **Privacy** .

6. Also, make sure the app you’re using now is turned on.  
![select the app you're using and turn it on](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/which-app.jpg)
7. Now check if HyperX Cloud Stinger’s microphone is working. If you have granted all the permissions to the microphone but you still can’t be heard, you can try the next fix.

**To allow apps to access your Microphone on a Mac**

1. Choose Apple menu ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/5E3B07C0094622B541F026E3/5E3B07C3094622B541F026EA/en_GB/2f77cc85238452e25cb517130188bf99.png) \>**System Preferences** , click**Sound** , then click**Input** .

3. Then go to**System Preferences** \>**Security and Privacy** \>**Privacy** , and select**Microphone** from the sidebar. You should see a list of apps that have requested access to your microphone. Make sure you have approved the app you want to use the microphone with.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/privacy-microphone.jpg)

 If you can talk to Siri but this app still isn’t working, check the app’s preferences to see if there are separate settings for input devices. But if everything works just fine in other apps, you can try reinstalling this app.

## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.
