## 1\. Check the connections

 Since HyperX Cloud Alpha comes with a detachable microphone, so it’s important to firmly insert the detachable cable plug to ensure full connectivity (you really need to push it into the headset). Also, make sure not to mute the Mic, and increase the volume to the max level. This is the final fix for many users.

 If you’re using HyperX Cloud Alpha on Xbox One, you’ll need an adapter. Make sure the Mute button is not active, and use the buttons on the adapter to adjust the sound and microphone volume. Then go to**Settings** , and go to**Audio** to make sure the microphone is on. (The Cloud Alpha S is only compatible with PC and PS4.)

## 5\. Change your microphone settings

 Normally, Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default input device once your headphone is plugged into. But sometimes you’ll need to set it as the default device manually:

1. Right-click on the sound icon in the lower-right corner of your desktop, and select **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sounds.jpg)
2. Go to the **Recording** tab, and make sure your **Headset Microphone** is set as the default device. If not, select your headphone and click **Set Default** .
