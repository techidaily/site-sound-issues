## Master the Art of Uninterrupted Discord Communication - Tackling Audio Problems Head-On

Discord allows players to better enjoy the game through real-time collaboration. But getting Discord to work properly might not be as easy: many gamers reported that the **Discord audio keeps cutting out in-game or during a voice call** . If you’re facing the same issue, here’re some fixes that proved to be working.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you hit the one that gives you luck.

7. **[Check if your system is corrupted](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Disable other audio devices

 Usually we have connected more than one audio device to our PC, and this might be causing the cut-out issue — Windows sometimes can’t determine which is the active device. In this case, you can **disable all the audio devices except the one you’re using** .

Here’s how:

1. At the bottom right corner of your screen, right-click the speaker icon and select**Sounds** .

2. Navigate to the**Playback** tab and find the devices that’re inactive. Right click those devices and select**Disable** . (Be advised that the headset you’re using might show more than one device. Check that according to the description.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/disable-other-audio-devices-2.jpg)
3. Restart Discord and your game and check if the audio is back to normal.

If this fix doesn’t help you, simply take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: Disable QoS High Packet Priority

 Some users reported that a Discord feature named**Quality of Service High Packet Priority** is causing lag spikes in game, and some specialists suggest that disabling this option could be a fix to the audio-cutting-out problem. You can try the same and see if there’s any improvement.

1. Open Discord and go to**User Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/discord-disable-qos-1.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select**Voice & Video** . Under the**QUALITY OF SERVICE** section, make sure**Enable Quality of Service High Packet Priority** is set to disable.

### Fix 4: Update your audio driver

 According to the feedback, the audio cutting out issue is very likely driver-related. In other words, it could mean that**the audio driver you’re using is broken or out of date** . For your PC to stay in the best shape, you should always make sure to have the latest drivers.

 You can update your audio driver manually, by visiting the PC/motherboard manufacturer’s website, searching for your model and downloading the latest correct installer. If you don’t have the time or patience to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 It’s also possible that some conflicting programs are messing up with your audio settings. To check if it’s a compatibility issue, you can do a clean boot and root out the offenders.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-disable-services-except-gpu-audio.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  at the same time to open Task Manager, then navigate to the **Startup**  tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup.jpg)
5. One at a time, select any programs you suspect might be interfering, and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/task-manager-startup-disable-startup-program.jpg)
6. Restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now check if the audio is back on track. If so, repeat these steps but only disable half of the programs and services.

If this fix doesn’t work for you, take a look at the next one.

### Fix 6: Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates help you avoid lots of strange issues. Normally it’s done automatically, but you can check for updates manually and see if some patches are left out.

Here’s a quick guide for that:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

<a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872456/14483" target="_top" id="1872456"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872456" border="0" alt="" width="500" height="375"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872456/14483" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 After installing all the system updates, restart your PC and check the audio in game.

### Fix 7: Check if your system is corrupted
