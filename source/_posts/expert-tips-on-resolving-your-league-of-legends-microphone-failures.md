### Fix 3 – Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of Zoom microphone not working is an outdated or a faulty audio driver. To keep your audio devices work in the tip-top condition, you should install the latest audio driver.

There are two ways you can update your audio driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your audio device or motherboard, and search for the most recent driver. After you download the correct driver that’s compatible with your Windows version, follow the on-screen instructions to install it manully.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 The up-to-date audio driver should make you use the microphone on Zoom without trouble. If this method isn’t helpful, there are a few more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Modify Zoom’s audio settings

 If your microphone works well on other programs and only runs into problems on Zoom, the reason may be the app’s settings. You can adjust the settings as follows and see whether this brings back your audio input.

**1)** Launch Zoom. Then, click the**cogwheel icon** on the top right corner to enter Zoom’s settings.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1.jpg)

**2)** Click the**Audio** tab, select the right microphone you’re using from the drop-down menu next to Microphone.

**4)** Click the**Advanced** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-4.jpg)

**5)** Configure the settings as below:

* **Suppress Intermittent Background Noise** :_Moderate_ or_Disable_
* **Echo cancellation** :_Auto_

 Join a meeting to test if your microphone works on Zoom. If you see the microphone icon with a red line in the bottom bar, it’s muted, and you need to click the icon to unmute it before other participants can hear you. If the mic-not-working problem remains, please check out the last fix.
