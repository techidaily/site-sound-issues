### Method 2: Update your audio drivers

 The mic on your Astro A50 headset won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time consuming, technical and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install**Driver Easy** .
2. Run**Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button.**Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

(This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) — if you don’t already have it, you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 Once you’ve updated the driver for your Astro A50 headset, restart your computer. Then log in again and see if the microphone is working.

### Method 3: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If your headset microphone is still not working, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, there are a few things you need to do.

 First, try connecting your headset to**another port** on your computer. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to the port you’re using.

 If changing the port doesn’t work for you, connect your headset to**another computer** and see if this fixes your microphone. If it does, then you should contact the vendor of your computer for advice.

 If nothing above helps you, the issues may be on your headset. Then you should contact Astro for support or have your headset serviced.
