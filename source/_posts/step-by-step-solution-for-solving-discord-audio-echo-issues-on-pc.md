## **3\. DPC Latency**

 In some cases, high latency could be the cause of your static audio among many other audio problems. Luckily, there’s a handy tool called **DPC Latency Checker** . It helps monitor your PC performance and tells you what’s causing the latency.

 1) Download[**DPC Latency Checker**](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) and click the download file to open it.

 2) If you’re seeing green bars as shown in the screenshot below, and nothing in the top red section, your PC is in a good state. Move on to the next step below.

 3) If this screenshot is different from what you’re seeing, you’ll also see which device is causing the latency like this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a533a0c245d.png)

 Try disabling your device drivers from Device Manager as shown in **[Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  one by one.

 If you find disabling certain drivers reduce the latency a lot, then you have to reinstall the device drivers to the latest version. You can update all the needed device drivers one by one by yourself. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
