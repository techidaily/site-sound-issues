## **2\. Disable ATI HDMI Audio**

 In some cases, ATI HDMI Audio device in your Device Manager could be the culprit of the popping sound on your Windows PC. You can disable it for your audio to go back to normal again. To do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then choose **Device Manager** .

 2) Click to expand **Sound, video and game controllers** category. Right-click ATI HDMI Audio device driver if you can see it here and select **Disable device** .

If you don’t see this option here, move on to the next steps.

## **3\. DPC Latency**

 In some cases, high latency could be the cause of your static audio among many other audio problems. Luckily, there’s a handy tool called **DPC Latency Checker** . It helps monitor your PC performance and tells you what’s causing the latency.

 1) Download[**DPC Latency Checker**](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) and click the download file to open it.

 2) If you’re seeing green bars as shown in the screenshot below, and nothing in the top red section, your PC is in a good state. Move on to the next step below.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a5313c8fd13.png)

 3) If this screenshot is different from what you’re seeing, you’ll also see which device is causing the latency like this:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_59a533a0c245d.png)

 Try disabling your device drivers from Device Manager as shown in **[Step 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  one by one.

 If you find disabling certain drivers reduce the latency a lot, then you have to reinstall the device drivers to the latest version. You can update all the needed device drivers one by one by yourself. If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
