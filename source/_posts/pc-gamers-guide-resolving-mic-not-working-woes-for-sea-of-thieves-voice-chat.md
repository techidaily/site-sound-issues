 Open the game to test the voice chat in Sea of Thieves. If it still fails to work, check your audio driver.

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 Faulty or outdated device drivers can lead to various gaming issues. If you don’t remember the last time you update your drivers, definitely do it now, as this could keep your audio devices in tip-top condition and very well tackle the Sea of Theives voice chat not working issue.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the audio driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update audio driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6 – Check the in-game audio settings

1. While in-game, press the**Esc key** on your keyboard and select**My Crew** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-1.jpg)

4. Select**Audio Settings** from the left pane. Then, make sure the**Crew Chat Output** is set to the correct device and**Push To Talk is turned on** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/in-game-settings-4.jpg)

 Now relaunch Sea of Thieves to test. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one below.

### Fix 7 – Check the Party Chat settings

 If you’ve set up Xbox Party Chat, you also need to enable the chat access in Xbox settings. Otherwise, you might not use the voice chat in Sea of Thieves as intended. Follow the instruction below to do this.

1. Open your browser and go to **[account.xbox.com](http://account.xbox.com/)**  . Then, log into your account.
2. Click your**user name** at the upper right corner and select**Xbox settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-2.jpg)
4. Under the**You Can** section, tick**Allow** next to **You can communicate outside of Xbox Live with voice & text** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-3.jpg)
5. Scroll to the**Others can** section. For**Others can communicate with voice, text, or invites** , select**Everyone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-4.jpg)
6. Open your Xbox app. Then click your**avatar** at the upper right corner and click**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-6.jpg)
7. Select**Audio** from the left pane. Make sure you’ve set your gaming headset as both the input and output device, and also**toggle on Push to talk** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/xbox-settings-7.jpg)

 After you’ve made those tweaks, launch SoT again to test whether you can talk to your crews. If not, try the last fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8 – Temporarily disable your antivirus

 According to some players, Sea of Thieves voice chat won’t work when their antivirus is enabled. The anti-virus software aims to protect your PC from potential threats but sometimes it can block certain features of other apps or games. To see if that’s the cause, turn off the antivirus and relaunch your game. If the problem gets fixed,**add SoT into the exception list** so that you can use both without conflicts.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.
