## Before you begin

 Before you start trying the fixes below, you should simply have a basic check on your headset as follows:

* Check the physical mute button on the left earcup to make sure that your headset is not muted.
* Charge the headset to check if it has run out of battery.
* Connect the headset to another PC. If the G935 mic still doesn’t work, it’s most likely because the headset has expired.

 Restart your PC and test your microphone to see if it works properly now. If not, move on to the next fix below.

## Method 4: Reinstall Logitech Gaming Software

 A conflict between your PC and the Logitech Gaming Software could also be the source of the issue.To solve the conflict, you need to reinstall the software that allows your computer to reload data from your Logitech headset. Here’s how it’s done:

1. Press the**Windows + R** keys to open the Run command. Type**appwiz.cpl** in the text box and then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/uninstall-corsair-driver-4.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-4-1.jpg)
3. After uninstalling the program, head to ​[**Logitech’s support website**](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025298053) and download the latest version of Logitech Gaming Software that matches your operating system.

4. Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software.

 Connect your Logitech G935 to your computer and check the mic to see if you can use it now.

## Method 5: Try an external sound card

 When the sound card or the audio port of your laptop/desktop computer is somehow defective, your headset mic could fail to work. To check if that’s the case and solve the problem, you can try a USB audio card. It’s an external device that can**bypass**   **issues in your built-in sound card or audio port, and recover the audio function** when you need to use your Logitech headset mic.
