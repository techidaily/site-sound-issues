## No Sound From Speakers in Windows? Here's How You Can Get Them Working Again

Sometimes you may find that there’s**no sound after plugging your speaker** into your computer. This is frustrating. But don’t worry. You can fix the**speakers plugged in but no sound** issue in your computer.

## Try these fixes

 Here are solutions that have helped people resolve the same problem. You don’t have to try them all, just work your way down the list until your speaker works again.

1. [Troubleshoot the hardware problems](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your sound card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Configure the audio settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Troubleshoot the hardware problems

 Your speakers are plugged in but no sound? You’ll need to troubleshoot in the first place. During troubleshooting, make sure your volume is not muted. If your volume is muted, you’ll see a cross icon next to your volume icon. Click your**volume icon** and drag the slider to the**maximum** to see if there’s any sound from your speaker.

 It’s possible that your speaker is not connected correctly because of hardware problems, so you’ll find your speakers are plugged but no sound at all. To rule it out as the cause of your problem, try troubleshooting:

1. Ensure you’ve plugged your speaker into the correct**speaker jack** . For some computers or laptops, there are headphone jacks for microphone and headset, and jacks for line-in and line-out. So make sure it’s the correct headphone jack to connect.
2. Ensure your speaker jack works correctly. If something causes your headphone jack to malfunction, your speaker won’t be detected and you can’t hear any sound from your computer. Or you can plug your speaker into another computer and see if it works.

 If your speaker works and the sound is working on another computer, it should be a problem of that computer that doesn’t work. Then try[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 If your speaker doesn’t work on another computer, it seems to be a problem with your speaker and you should ask the manufacturer for advice (get a replacement or have it repaired).

### Fix 2: Update your sound card driver

 If your sound card driver is missing or outdated, you’ll have sound problems like your speakers plugged in but no sound, so you should update your sound card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** – You can go to the website of your audio card manufacturer, find the latest correct driver for your sound card, and then download and install it manually into your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

OR

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with[**Driver** **Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Open Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan the problem drivers on your computer.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Needed.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio device to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install it on your computer.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Driver-Easy-Update-audio-driver.jpg)  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All and get a**30-day money-back guarantee** ).
