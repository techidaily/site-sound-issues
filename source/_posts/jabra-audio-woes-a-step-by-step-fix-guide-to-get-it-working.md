## Before we move further…

 Here are some quick checkups that you can do with your computer and your Jabra headset:

1. Disconnect your Jabra headset from other devices (like your mobile phone) and leave your computer only to see if it works properly.
2. Restart your computer and your Jabra headset, then try the connection again.
3. Make sure that your Jabra headset is fully charged.

## Fix 1 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver on your computer is corrupted, faulty or outdated, a headset may not connect to the PC or work correctly. You may find the mic is malfunctioning or there’s no sound at all. In this case, you should run a scan and**install the latest correct audio driver** .

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you could go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and download the correct driver that’s compatible with your operating system.

 But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your audio device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

 If the audio-not-working issue only occurs in a few specific programs, make sure you’ve **set your Jabra headset as the default device in the app settings** . Now see if the audio works. If not, take a look at more fixes below.

## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer. The reset button varies on different Jabra headsets, but normally you could**hold the multi-function button for around 10 seconds** to clear the settings.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-1.jpg)
