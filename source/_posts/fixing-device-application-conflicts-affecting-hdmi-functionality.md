### Method 2: Update your audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop the mic from working in Fortnite. You can try **updating your audio driver** to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver —**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your audio driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your audio driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf4e77d496c.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically.  (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)

### Method 4: Allow apps to access your mic

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Click**Privacy** .

3. In the left pane, click **Microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b88ebcdd1f01.jpg)
4. In the right pane, click the**Change** button, and you’ll see your mic is turned on. Also make sure**All apps to access your microphone** is enabled:  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf492ca1d0f.jpg)
5. In the section of**Choose which apps can access your microphone** , verify that**Fortnite is turned on** .

6. Test in Fortnite.

#### Windows 11

4. Now test your voice chat in-game.

### Method 5: Check for Windows updates

 If the above methods didn’t work for you, your**Fortnite mic not working** problem is probably being caused by**system issues** . Then, you can check for**Windows updates** .

1. Type**update** in the Windows search box, then press**Enter** .
2. Click**check for updates** in the pop-up window.
3. Install all identified updates to troubleshoot the issue.
