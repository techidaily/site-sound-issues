 Now that everything is set up in the right way, test your microphone in Microsoft Team. If it still fails to work, check out the next fix.

### Fix 4 â€“ Update your audio driver

 The Microsoft Teams mic not working issue may indicate problems with your audio driver. To ensure the microphone work smoothly when youâ€™re on an online class or meeting, you should always keep the audio driver upâ€“to-date. Here are two ways for you to update the audio driver: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### Option 1 â€“ Download and install the driver manually

 To update the driver manually, you can visit the PC or the headset manufacturerâ€™s website and search for the most recent driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit).

 Once youâ€™ve downloaded the right driver for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

#### Option 2 â€“ Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the drivers for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but itâ€™s partly manual.
