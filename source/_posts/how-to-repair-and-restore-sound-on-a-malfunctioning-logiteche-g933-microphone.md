## Logitech G Pro X Headset Microphone Malfunction? Here's How to Repair It

When it comes to gaming equipment, the Logitech G series is a go-to option for many. However, there have been some complaints about the Logitech G Pro X microphone not working issue. It’s very annoying when you can’t talk to others on the mic, but in fact, this problem is not hard to solve.

## Fixes to try

 Here are 5 fixes that helped other users with the Logitech G Pro mic not working issue. You may not try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

2. **[Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall G Hub](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.
* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-25.png)
2. Make sure**Microphone access** and**Logitech G Pro X** are both set to**On** .

**On Windows 10:**

2. Click the**Change** button and**turn on** the Microphone access for this device.

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 The sound settings may sometimes be messed up after a system update and thus you need to configure the proper setup manually.

1. In the search box, type**control** **panel** and select**Control Panel** .

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your headset from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)
