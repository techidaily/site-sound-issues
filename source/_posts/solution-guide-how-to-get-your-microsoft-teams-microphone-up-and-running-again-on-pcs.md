### Fix 4 – Allow access to your SteelSeries Arctis 7 microphone

 If your SteelSeries Arctis 7 mic refuses to work after a new system update, it’s likely Windows has disabled the apps from accessing your microphone. If so, you need to allow the permission manually.

### Fix 5 – Reinstall the SteelSeries Engine software

 The SteelSeries Engine software offers users better control over their SteelSeries gaming devices, but sometimes the app updates can mess with your SteelSeries Arctis headset. In this case, try to reinstall the program to cure the mic not working problem.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open Run command. Then, type**appwiz.cpl** and click**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-2-8.jpg)

**2)** Right-click**SteelSeries Engine** and click**Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-3-7.jpg)

**3)** Go to the **[SteelSeries official website](https://steelseries.com/engine)**  .

**4)** Click**Windows** to download the latest version of SteelSeries Engine.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1-8.jpg)

**5)** Follow the on-screen instruction to install the SteelSeries Engine software.

**6)** Reconnect your SteelSeries Arctis 7 headset to the computer.

It should be automatically detected and function normally.

 If all the fixes above couldn’t get your SteelSeries Arctis 7 mic working, then check whether your headset is physically broken. Simply try it on another PC. If it doesn’t work either, you’re suggested to ask the vendor for further assistance.
