## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver:**manually** or**automatically** .

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your headset from **[Logitech’s support website](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-us)**  . Then, download the driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
