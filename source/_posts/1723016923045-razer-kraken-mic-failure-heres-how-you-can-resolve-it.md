## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you can do some troubleshooting via the steps below.

* **Test your Corsair on the other computer** to make sure it’s not physicially broken.
* Repair the connection. Simply**replug the Corsair headset** into your PC and**try another USB port** .  

 If you’re using the wireless dongle, use a paper clip to**press into the tiny hole** near the dongle’s LED. When it starts to blink, hold the**Power button** on your headset until the dongle’s LED turns solid.

 If you confirm there is no problem related to hardware, continue to the second fix below.

## Fix 2 – Update your audio driver

 The audio driver is essential for a headset or microphone to work properly. If it’s missing, faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Corsair headset not working problem. To keep your headset up and running all the time, make sure to install the latest device drivers.

 You can search for the most recent driver from the official website of your PC manufacturer or the[**Corsair download page**](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/downloads) and install it manually.

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Corsair headset will be set as default automatically once it’s connected properly. But if you’ve constantly changed between the headsets and speakers, the settings might be messed up. And you’ll need to configure the correct setup manually.

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-0.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by and click**Sound** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-1.jpg)
3. On the**Playback** tab, make sure your Corsair headset is enabled (covered with a green check mark). Then, click it and click**Set Default** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/sound-settings-3.jpg)
4. Navigate to the**Recording** tab. Select the Corsair headset microphone and click**Set Default** .

 Once completed, check if your Corsair headset functions well. If not, try to troubleshoot the firmware.

## Fix 4 – Update the firmware

 A firmware update, which includes performance improvement and bug fixes, is necessary for the proper functioning of devices. If your Corsair headset somehow stops working, try updating the firmware to see if that helps your case.

1. Connect your Corsair headset to the computer.
2. Launch iCUE. If you don’t have one, **[download it](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/icue)**  .
3. Navigate to the**Settings** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-1-1.jpg)
4. Select your headset first, then check**Force update** and click the**Update** button.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/firmware-update.jpg)

 Wait for the process to complete and see how your headset works. Still no luck with the firmware update? Don’t worry. Check out the last solution.

## Fix 5 – Reinstall iCUE

 iCUE is a powerful tool that helps you control and customize your Corsair devices ([learn more](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ). However, users reported that the latest iCUE update may conflict with the operating system and cause Corsair headset not to work. To fix this, you should reinstall the Corsair audio driver and iCUE as well.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Then type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/uninstall-corsair-driver-0.jpg)
2. Double-click**Audio inputs and outputs** to expand the list.
