 Try to see if your Bluetooth starts working properly. If the problem remains, please move on.

## Fix 6: Repair your system files

 It’s possible that Bluetooth not working issue is caused by a Windows system error. Corrupt, damaged, or missing system files can cause Windows issues. To check if this is the exact cause, you can either use the Windows built-in tool to run a basic check or use an automatic tool to perform a complete diagnosis.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/windows-11-bluetooth-not-working/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fit for you.
* [Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
