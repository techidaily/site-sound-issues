## Logitech G Pro X Headset Microphone Malfunction? Here's How to Repair It

When it comes to gaming equipment, the Logitech G series is a go-to option for many. However, there have been some complaints about the Logitech G Pro X microphone not working issue. It’s very annoying when you can’t talk to others on the mic, but in fact, this problem is not hard to solve.

## Fixes to try

 Here are 5 fixes that helped other users with the Logitech G Pro mic not working issue. You may not try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

4. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall G Hub](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.
* Make sure the**mute switch is disabled** .

If everything is fine with the hardware, read on to more fixes below.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .

2. Make sure**Microphone access** and**Logitech G Pro X** are both set to**On** .

 Now that your Logitech Pro X microphone is set as default and the volume is turned up, test the issue again. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.

## Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the Logitech Pro X microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work in tip-top condition as always, you should install the latest audio driver.
