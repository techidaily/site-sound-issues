## Fix 4: Update your audio drivers

 The outdated or corrupted audio driver would also cause the headset mic not to work. Many users find that re-installing/updating audio drivers makes their headset mic work again.

 You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time-consuming, technical, and error-prone, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.

 Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install **Driver Easy** .
2. Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy** will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![Scan now](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to your sound device or your headset to download the latest and correct driver for it.  

 You can also click the **Update All** button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — if you don’t already have it, you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)
