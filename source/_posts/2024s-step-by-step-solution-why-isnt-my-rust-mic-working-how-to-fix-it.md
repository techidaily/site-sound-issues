## Troubleshooting: Why Isn't My Mic Working? Solutions Inside

If your**microphone can’t pick up your voice** despite the computer recognizing that it’s plugged in, you can try using your mic on your phone to check if it’s a hardware issue. If your mic works on your phone but not on your computer, you can then try the methods below to troubleshoot the problem.

## Troubleshoot mic problems

1. [**Update your audio driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. **[Set your mic as your default device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. [**Allow apps to access your mic (Windows 10)**](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-microphone-not-picking-up-voice/#m3)
4. [**Check in-game settings**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Check for Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Update your audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver may stop mic from picking up voice. Make sure that the audio driver on your PC is up to date.

 There are two ways to update your audio driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manual driver update** — You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact audio device model and your version of Windows.

**Automatic driver update** — If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to your audio device to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE** version).  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc5cb179f761.jpg)  
**Note:** If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** .

 Then, you can use the built-in**Speech Recognition** tool to test your microphone:

1. In the Windows search box, type**Speech Recognition** and click the matching result.

2. Click**Set up microphone** , and follow the Microphone Setup Wizard.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc6b23de4e69.jpg)
3. When you reach “Adjust the microphone volume”, please note if the volume bar moves from yellow to red.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 4: Check in-game settings

 If you have everything configured properly and your mic still doesn’t seem to work in game, you’d better check the in-game audio or voice chat settings.

 Make sure the **voice chat input/output device** is set as**default** in game. And try**turning off voice chat** , then**checking the audio settings on PC** as mentioned in Method 2 above, and then**turning on voice chat** in game again.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 5: Check for Windows updates

1. Type **update** in the Windows search box, then press **Enter** .
2. Click **check for updates** in the pop-up window.
3. Install all identified updates to troubleshoot the issue.
