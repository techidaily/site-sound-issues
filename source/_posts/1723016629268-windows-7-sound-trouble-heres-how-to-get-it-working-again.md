 4) Reboot your Windows 7\. Windows should reinstall the audio driver automatically.

 5) Play a music or a video on your Windows 7\. Check to see if there is sound.

 If your Windows 7 still keeps no sound, not to be frustrated, move on to the Method 4 to update your audio driver.

### Method 4: Automatically update your audio driver

 The methods above may resolve the problem, but if they don’t, please update your audio driver. If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
