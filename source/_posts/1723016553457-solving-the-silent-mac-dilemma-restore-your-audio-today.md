### Fix 1: Check sound on different apps

 Make sure you play sound on different apps (say Youtube, iTunes, Spotify etc.). Check if it’s only on one app that you have this **no sound problem** :

* If**yes** , then that particular buggy app is to blame. Update/delete the app should have smoothed out the problem.
* If**no** (no sound on ALL apps), then move on to**Fix 2** .

---

### Fix 2: Disconnect external speakers

 Sometimes you can’t hear any sound from your Mac because it sends the audio to its external devices, such as headphones, TV, etc. Unplug all of them and check if you can hear the sound. If no, go with**Fix 3** .

---

### Fix 3: Check the audio settings

 If the volume on your computer is set mute or too low, you won’t be able to hear the sound. To make sure you have turned up the volume:

 If instead of**Internal Speakers** , you see **Digital Output** or**No output devices found** , then insert your headphone into the headphone port and pull it out. Keep plugging and unplugging until **Internal Speakers** appears. Then repeat step 2).

3) Check if you get sound back on your Mac.

### Fix 4: Turn off Bluetooth

 Sometimes this**no sound problem** happens because you have your Bluetooth on and it sends the audio to the device your computer is connected to. If that’s the case, we need to turn off Bluetooth to eliminate any glitches resulting from this.

 1) Click**System preferences** \>**Bluetooth** . Check if it says **Bluetooth: On** :

* If**yes** : click**Turn Bluetooth Off** , then click the close button.

* If**no** (i.e. **Bluetooth: Off** ): click the**Close** button. Proceed to Fix 5.

 2) Check if the**no sound problem** has been solved.

### Fix 5: Restart your Mac

 A simple restart can fix many minor issues our computer is having, including audio problems. After the restart, you can check again and see if you get the sound back.

### Fix 6: Reset **NVRAM**

 By resetting NVRAM, we bring back the default settings (including speaker volume, time zone, and display solution etc.). This may well help solve sound-related problems.

1) Shut down your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2) Turn on your computer by pressing the power button, and IMMEDIATELY hold down**the** **Command key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b029439e60ea.png) **, the options/alt key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b02946710198.png) ,**P** and**R** at the same time.

3) Don’t release the keys before you hear the start-up sound. (This reboot will take up to 20 seconds.)

4) After the start-up, your computer will be refreshed to the default settings. This time, you might need to  reconfigure settings for speaker volume, time zone, and display solution etc.

5) Test to see if the sound works properly.

### Fix **7: Create a testing account on safe mode**

2) To enter safe mode, hold down the**Shift** key and press the**power** button. Don’t let go of the**Shift** key until you see the Apple logo.

 Note: no password for this account is needed since it’s only a testing account.

 7) You’ll be asked to confirm creating a new account without a password. Click**OK** \> the**Close** button.

 8) Restart your computer and log in with**the new user account** you just created. Check the sound and see if it works properly:

* If**yes** , it indicates the profile of the previous Apple account is probably corrupted. Proceed with 9) and contact[Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-ph) to help fix your previous Apple account.
* If**no** , then proceed with 9) and move on to**Fix 8** .

 9) Click **System Preferences** \> **Users & Groups** \> the**Lock** icon > the**Minus** icon to delete your testing account.

### Fix **8: Update your Mac OS**

 If all the fixes above don’t solve your problem, then you might have to update your OS. Sometimes the older system can have some sound problems and Apple will roll out new versions to fix them.

 IMPORTANT: before you upgrade to the new OS, make sure you have backed up your Mac.

 1) Click**App store** \> **Updates** .

 2) Click the latest Mac OS to update.

 3) Wait for the download and install, then your computer will restart automatically.

 4) Check if you get sound back on your Mac.

 If all else fails, then you’ll probably be best off contacting[Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-ph)  or having this fixed in a trustworthy computer repair shop.
