6. Reboot your computer and go back to the game, you should have audio now.

### Fix 5: Update your audio driver

 One reason for many computer errors is outdated drivers for your hardware devices. You should verify that your devices have the right and latest drivers, and update those that don‚Äôt.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers: manually or automatically.

**Download and install the driver manually** ‚Äì You can update your driver manually by going to the manufacturer‚Äôs website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically update drivers** ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt have the time, patience or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install it correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update button** next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 6: Restart the game

 If the ‚ÄúAnthem no sound‚Äù error is nothing to do with the hardware, audio program and windows system, the error is caused by the game itself.

 Make sure you‚Äôve got the latest version for Anthem. If you don‚Äôt, update your game version. Except for waiting for Anthem releases a new update to solve the bug, the only current way to deal with the bug is to reboot the game.
