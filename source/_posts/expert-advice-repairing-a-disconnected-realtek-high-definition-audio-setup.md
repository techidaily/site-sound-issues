##  Method 1: Make sure your computer sound is going through your sound card

 To ensure your Stereo Mix works well, all your audio output has to go through your sound card so that it can record the output. If your sound is sent around the sound card (using HDMI to output video and audio together, for example), your Stereo Mix is unable to work.

 To use Stereo Mix, you should make sure your computer sound is coming from your sound card. Connect your sound card directly to your speakers and set up the proper output. After that, check to see if your Stereo Mix works normally.

##  Method 2: Update your sound driver

 Your Stereo Mix may not be working properly if you’re using a wrong sound driver or it’s out of date. You should update your driver to see if this is able to resolve your problem. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
