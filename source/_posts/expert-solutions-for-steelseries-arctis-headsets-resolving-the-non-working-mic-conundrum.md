### Fix 1: Set up the microphone correctly

 Before you try the following fixes, please make sure the mute button is not activated.

 Also, the microphone is highly directional, so it must be placed properly to achieve the best sound quality.

### Fix 2: Allow access to your microphone

 The first thing you need to make sure of is that your device allows apps to access your microphone. This is especially true if you can‚Äôt be heard in any apps.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

 1) In the Windows Search box, type**microphone,** and select**Microphone privacy settings** .

 2) Please be sure to turn on ‚Äú**Allow access to the microphone on this device** ‚Äù and ‚Äú**Allow apps to access your microphone** ‚Äú.

 Now you can test recording and see if your SteelSeries Arctis Pro mic is working right now. But if not, please move on to the next fix.

 In most cases, when you plug your headset into the computer, it will be set as the default device on the computer. But sometimes it can bump into issues. If your SteelSeries Actis Pro mic is not working, your headset may be disabled or not set as the default device.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and the **R** key at the same time to open the Run box.

### Fix 4: Update the headset driver
