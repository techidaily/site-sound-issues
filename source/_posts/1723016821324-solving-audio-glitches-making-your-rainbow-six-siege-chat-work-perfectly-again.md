## 1\. Turn on app permissions for your microphone

 To use your microphone with apps on Windows, you’ll need to turn on some permissions in Microphone settings. Here’s how:

 1) Press the**Windows logo key + R** at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Click**Privacy** .

 5) Once you’ve allowed microphone access to your apps, you can change the settings for each app. Simply head to the**Choose which Microsoft apps can access your microphone** , and turn on apps you want to use with it. For desktop apps, make sure that**Allow desktop apps to access your microphone** is turned**On** .

 After you’ve done all of these, try to use your headset microphone and check if it’s working properly. If the issue persists, try the next fix below.

## 2\. Make sure your mic isn’t disabled

 Sometimes you may not notice that your microphone has accidentally been disabled, which can sometimes happen on Windows. To check if that’s your case, take these steps:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select**Open Sound settings** .

 3) Make sure that your headset is not disabled.

 After you’ve confirmed that your microphone is enabled, do a test to check if it’s now back to normal. If the microphone is still not working properly, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Set your microphone device as default

 Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But sometimes it just fails to do that and you have to set it manually:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select**Open Sound settings** .

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) Select the**Recording** tab. Select your microphone and then click**Set Default > OK** .  
  
![set your device as default](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/set-it-as-default.png)

 When it’s all done, use your microphone to check if it’s working now. If you’re still having the same problem, try the next fix below.

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 The mic on your RUNMUS gaming headsets won’t work correctly if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio driver. Outdated drivers can become incompatible with an update to Windows, or you may be lacking a new feature required for the microphone to function properly. In this case, you should update the driver and the issue can be resolved.

 You can update the audio driver from the PC or Device maker’s Support downloads web page. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you.

Here’s how to update drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)

## 5\. Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If nothing else helps and your microphone is still not working, it’s likely that there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, do some basic checks as follows:

 1) Try plugging your headset into another microphone input jack in case the one you previously used is broken.

 2) Connect your headset to another device to check if it’s functioning properly. If it fails to work either, the issue may be on your headset. Then you should contact the RUNMUS or customer service for further assistance.
