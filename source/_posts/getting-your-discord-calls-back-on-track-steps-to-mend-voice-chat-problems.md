## Discord Not Working? Here's How to Get Your Voice Back in Conversations

Randomly can’t hear anyone on Discord? You’re not alone. This can happen when the audio isn’t working and you’ll need to tweak some settings.

 Before performing any of the troubleshooting steps listed below, it’s best to**restart your computer first** . This action refreshes the operating system and removes any corrupt temporary data that could be causing the problem.

 Also, you’re supposed to**do an audio test** to make sure that your headphones or speakers are working. You can play some music on Youtube. If you don’t hear anything, you’re probably having a headset or speaker issue. If your audio device is producing sound, try these fixes:

1. **[Refresh your Discord app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Use Legacy Audio Subsystem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (could be the best shot you take)
4. **[Set the audio device as the default](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Use the correct output device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 4: Set the audio device as the default

 The easy steps you can take in fixing your audio output issue is by making sure your audio device is set to your primary output device.

To make sure your audio device is correctly set, take these steps:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select**Open Sound settings** .
