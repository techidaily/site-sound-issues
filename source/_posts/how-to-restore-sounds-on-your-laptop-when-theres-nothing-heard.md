 Alternatively, utilities like **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  comprehensively scan your entire system for stability issues, damaged files, malware infections, and more. Fortect then repairs corrupted Windows files by replacing them with healthy versions without deleting user data. This**automated repair** process restores system stability and functionality.

 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you **a detailed report of your PC status** .
