## Discord Not Working? Here's How to Get Your Voice Back in Conversations

Randomly can’t hear anyone on Discord? You’re not alone. This can happen when the audio isn’t working and you’ll need to tweak some settings.

 Before performing any of the troubleshooting steps listed below, it’s best to**restart your computer first** . This action refreshes the operating system and removes any corrupt temporary data that could be causing the problem.

 Also, you’re supposed to**do an audio test** to make sure that your headphones or speakers are working. You can play some music on Youtube. If you don’t hear anything, you’re probably having a headset or speaker issue. If your audio device is producing sound, try these fixes:

1. **[Refresh your Discord app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Use Legacy Audio Subsystem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (could be the best shot you take)
4. **[Set the audio device as the default](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Use the correct output device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Refresh your Discord app

 Sometimes the problem is temporary and performing a refresh on the Discord app can fix it. To do this, simply press the**Ctrl+R** key to automatically refresh and reboot the app. This will trigger an update. Once done, check if you can hear people now.

If that didn’t work, proceed to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Use Legacy Audio Subsystem

 There are instances where there’s an incompatibility between your hardware and Discord’s latest subsystem. Therefore, it’s recommended to revert to Legacy Audio Subsystem to fix the issue. To do this, follow these steps:

 1) Open the Discord app. Click on**Settings** (the gear icon beside your avatar).  
  
![open Discord settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Discord-settings.jpg)

 2) On the left pane, select**Voice & Video** . Scroll down to the**AUDIO SUBSYSTEM** section. Click on the down arrow and select**Legacy** .

Once Discord reboots, check to see if the problem is resolved.

## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 An audio driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with your sound card. If it is outdated or misconfigured, it will cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, you would need to update your audio driver.

##### How to update your audio driver

 To update your audio driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy.

OR

 You can do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater. It will help you detect any outdated drivers, then download, and install the correct drivers for your system. With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

## Fix 4: Set the audio device as the default

 The easy steps you can take in fixing your audio output issue is by making sure your audio device is set to your primary output device.

To make sure your audio device is correctly set, take these steps:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select**Open Sound settings** .
