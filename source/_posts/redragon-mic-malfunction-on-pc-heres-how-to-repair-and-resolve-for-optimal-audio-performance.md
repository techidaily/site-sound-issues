## Fix 3 – Reset the Jabra headset and connection

 If you’ve been constantly running into glitches with your Jabra headset, try to reset the device settings to the default and reconnect it with your computer. The reset button varies on different Jabra headsets, but normally you could**hold the multi-function button for around 10 seconds** to clear the settings.

 Once done, re-establish the connection. If you’re connecting the Jabra headset via a cable, simply**unplug it, wait for a while and plug it back in** . It’s also suggested you**try another USB port** .

 If you’re using a Jabra wireless headset, take these steps to reset the pairing connection on the computer.

1. Type**bluetooth** on the Windows search bar and select**Bluetooth and other devices settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/bluetooth-connection-1.jpg)

Does your Jabra headset work now? If not, try the next method.

## Fix 4 – Check for damaged system files

So you should run a scan to check for any missing and corrupted system files. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a powerful Windows solution that can scan, diagnose, and repair damaged system files while keeping your settings and data.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

If restoring your computer still failed, there is the last method to try.

## Fix 5 – Update the firmware

 If neither of these methods helps, consider updating the firmware. Whether you’re using a corded or Bluetooth headphone, the firmware update can help you improve the device performance and prevent potential bugs.

1. Download **[Jabra Direct](https://www.jabra.com/software-and-services/jabra-direct)**  and launch the app.
2. Connect your Jabra headset to the computer and it should be automatically detected by the program.
3. Navigate to the**Updates** tab. Then, click the**Update** button next to each available device.
