## Discord Not Working? Here's How to Get Your Voice Back in Conversations

Randomly can’t hear anyone on Discord? You’re not alone. This can happen when the audio isn’t working and you’ll need to tweak some settings.

 Before performing any of the troubleshooting steps listed below, it’s best to**restart your computer first** . This action refreshes the operating system and removes any corrupt temporary data that could be causing the problem.

 Also, you’re supposed to**do an audio test** to make sure that your headphones or speakers are working. You can play some music on Youtube. If you don’t hear anything, you’re probably having a headset or speaker issue. If your audio device is producing sound, try these fixes:

1. **[Refresh your Discord app](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Use Legacy Audio Subsystem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (could be the best shot you take)
4. **[Set the audio device as the default](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Use the correct output device](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 An audio driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with your sound card. If it is outdated or misconfigured, it will cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, you would need to update your audio driver.

##### How to update your audio driver

 To update your audio driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy.

OR

 You can do it**automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , an automatic driver updater.

## Fix 4: Set the audio device as the default

 The easy steps you can take in fixing your audio output issue is by making sure your audio device is set to your primary output device. Most of the time, your audio device is already set as the default device. However, things may not work as expected. It can be an issue of your constantly changing between headphones and speakers. To make sure your audio device is correctly set, take these steps:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select**Open Sound settings** .  
  
![open sound setitngs](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/open-sound-settings.jpg)

 2) In the**Output** and**Input** section, make sure your audio device is set correctly.  
  
![set input and output device correctly](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/input-and-output-device.png)

 Once done, follow the steps below to set your audio device as the Default Communication Device:

 1) On your taskbar, right-click on the sound icon and select**Sounds** to open the Sound window.  
  
![set audio device as default Discord can't hear anyone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/click-on-Sounds.png)
