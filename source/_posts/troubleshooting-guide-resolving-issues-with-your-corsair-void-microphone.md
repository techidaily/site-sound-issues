## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .

 Once completed, check if your Corsair headset functions well. If not, try to troubleshoot the firmware.

## Fix 4 – Update the firmware

 A firmware update, which includes performance improvement and bug fixes, is necessary for the proper functioning of devices. If your Corsair headset somehow stops working, try updating the firmware to see if that helps your case.

1. Connect your Corsair headset to the computer.
2. Launch iCUE. If you don’t have one, **[download it](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/icue)**  .
3. Navigate to the**Settings** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-1-1.jpg)
4. Select your headset first, then check**Force update** and click the**Update** button.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/firmware-update.jpg)

 Wait for the process to complete and see how your headset works. Still no luck with the firmware update? Don’t worry. Check out the last solution.

## Fix 5 – Reinstall iCUE

 iCUE is a powerful tool that helps you control and customize your Corsair devices ([learn more](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).
