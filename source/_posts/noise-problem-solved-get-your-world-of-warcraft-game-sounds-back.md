### Fix 1:**Check your audio input device**

 There’re many reasons for microphone problems, but the first thing you should do when troubleshooting is to**check the physical connections** . Make sure the cables of your microphone are securely plugged into the**correct audio jack** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/audio-ports.jpg)

 Also check if your**cable** is damaged. If your microphone or headset has a**mute switch** , make sure it’s unmuted. You can also try plugging in the cable again to see if it gives you any luck, or you can use your cellphone or another computer for audio testing.

 If there’s nothing wrong with your input device, check out the next method.

## Fix 2: Configure your system microphone settings

 Normally when you plugged in your microphone, Windows will set it as the default recording device. But that’s not always the case. Sometimes you’ll need to configure this setting manually.

You can use these steps to check:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type or paste**ms-settings:sound** and click**OK** .

 If configuring in-game settings doesn’t give you any luck, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 4:**Update your audio driver**

 The voice chat issue could occur when you’re using a**faulty or outdated audio driver** . You should be sure that you’re using the latest audio driver, especially when you’ve spend top dollar for your peripherals, which often ship with edgy features that need to be unlocked by additional drivers.

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting each manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-audio-bluetooth-usb-unifying.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your audio driver, restart your computer and check the voice chat in WoW.

 If updating the audio driver failed to solve your case, simply move on to the next method.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate** , then press**Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-windows-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then search and install the system updates automatically. Once it’s done, restart your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)
