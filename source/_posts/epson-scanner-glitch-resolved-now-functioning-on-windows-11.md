### Fix 1: Check the connection issue

 To use your scanner, you need to make sure that your scanner is**powered on** in the first place.

 Then you should check the**connection** **issue** . If you’re using a USB scanner, check the**USB ports** and**USB cables** to ensure it works properly. While you’re using a network scanner, ensure your computer has a good**Internet** **connection** , and your scanner connects to your computer under the Internet. In addition, if you’re using **[VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  on your computer, try**disconnecting VPN** from your computer and scanning again.

 If you’ve checked the above steps and your HP scanner still doesn’t work, don’t worry. There is something else to try.

### Fix 2: Enable Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service and associated services

**Windows Image Acquisition** **(WIA)** is a Microsoft model that allows graphics software to communicate with imaging hardware such as scanners and cameras. So you should enable WIA service in your computer if your scanner stops working. Here’s what you need to do:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the**Run** box.
2. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd1678201865.jpg)
3. Scroll down and double click**Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd168549db26.jpg)  
 If the**Service status** is already**Running** , click**Stop** to stop the service, then click**Start** to re-enable the service.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd1678201865.jpg)
3. Ensure these services are set to**Automatic** and the**Service status** is**Running** .  
   * **Remote Procedure Call RPC**  
   * **DCOM Server Process Launcher**  
   * **RPC Endpoint Mapper**  
   * **Shell Hardware Detection**  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd169897b1a1.jpg)  
   **INFORMATION:**  
    The**Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)** service is dependent upon the**Shell Hardware Detection Service** , while the**Shell Hardware Detection Service** is dependent upon these services: Remote Procedure Call RPC, DCOM Server Process Launcher, and RPC Endpoint Mapper.
4. Save the changes and try your scanner again to see if it works.

### Fix 3: Update your scanner driver (Windows PC)

 A missing or outdated scanner driver can cause your HP scanner not to work, so you should update your scanner driver up to date.

 There are two ways to update your scanner driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update scanner driver** – You can go to the website of your scanner manufacturer, find the latest driver for your scanner, and install it on your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update scanner driver** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can download and install your drivers by using either the Free or Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes only 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money-back guarantee** ):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Driver-Easy-download-needed.jpg)
3. Click the Update button next to your scanner to download the latest driver (you can do this with the FREE version), then install it on your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install all problem drivers in your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/update-dell-touchpad-driver.jpg.png)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

Then try scanning with your scanner to see if it works.

### Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware problems

 It’s possible that there’s something wrong with your scanner, so run a troubleshooter in your computer to fix the issue.

1. Type**cmd** in the Windows Search bar and select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/cmd-run-as-admin.jpg)
2. Copy & paste the following command line into the Command Prompt window and press**Enter** .  
`**msdt.exe -id DeviceDiagnostic**`
3. Click**Next** in the popped-up window and the troubleshooter will start detecting hardware problems automatically.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033095&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Advanced-3YR.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/next-step.jpg)
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the troubleshooting and fix the detected issue.

 After that, try your scanner again and see if it’s working properly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Run System File Checker

 System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows feature that scans corrupted system files and repairs it automatically.

 Your HP scanning is not working because of some corrupted system files, so you can try SFC to fix the problem.

1. Type**cmd** in the search box, right-click Command Prompt, and select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd0319454560.jpg)
2. In Command Prompt, type the following command, then press**Enter** .  
sfc /scannow  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075461/7443" target="_top" id="2075461"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075461" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075461/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd031d993e59.jpg)
3. Then wait for**Verification 100% complete** . This can take a while.
4. Once complete, Type**exit** in Command Prompt and press**Enter** to close the window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd036dad46be.jpg)

Restart your computer and see if your scanner begins to work.

 However, sometimes the System File Checker may fail to detect critical or even some minor issues. If running the tool didn’t give you any luck, you should use a more powerful tool such as **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a more powerful tool that scans your computer for invalid registry issues, fragmented files, and Windows tweaks.

To fix your issues, follow the steps below to run a full scan of your PC:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.
