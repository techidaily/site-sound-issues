## Windows 11 Audio Enhancement Disabling Instructions – Do It Yourself

Audio enhancement packages are aimed to enhance your audio performance. But this feature sometimes causes problems with audio and sound. If you encounter a problem that you have no audio at all, you can try disabling audio enhancements to solve the problem.  

**Here’s how:**

1. In the right-bottom toolbar, right-click on the volume icon.
2. Click **Sounds** . ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1-5.jpg)
3. In the **Playback** tab, choose the device you’re using and click**Properties** .

4. In the **Enhancements** tab, tick “**Disable all sound effects** “. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/audio-1.jpg)
5. Click **Apply > OK** .

## What if you can’t find the Enhancements tab?

 Some people might find out that their Enhancements tab is missing. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. The below fixes can help you get it back.

**Note:** Always check your hardware connections first. Unplug and replug sometimes can fix many problems.

 If this easy fix can’t help, then you can update/reinstall the audio driver.

### Fix 1: Update the audio driver

 The outdated or missing drivers may be the reason for the “Enhancements missing” problem. You can update your audio driver to solve the problem. There are two ways you can update your audio drivers.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the [Realtek](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/) website, find the drivers for your system version and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
