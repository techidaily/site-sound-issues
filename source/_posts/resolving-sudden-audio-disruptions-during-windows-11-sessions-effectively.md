### Fix 1: Update the audio driver

 The outdated or missing drivers may be the reason for the “Enhancements missing” problem. You can update your audio driver to solve the problem. There are two ways you can update your audio drivers.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the [Realtek](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/) website, find the drivers for your system version and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
