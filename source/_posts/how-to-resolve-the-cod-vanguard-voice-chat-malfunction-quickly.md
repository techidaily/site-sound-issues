### Fix 1: Perform basic troubleshooting

 When your voice chat isn’t working, you can first do a basic troubleshooting step to see if it will fix the issue. You can follow the steps:

1. **Check the connection of your device.** Make sure your microphone or headset is plugged in properly.
2. If your microphone or headset has a mute switch,**make sure it’s unmuted** .
3. Try**unplugging and re-plugging** your microphone or headset.

 If everything is fine with your audio device, the problem may lie somewhere else. Read on to find out more.

### Fix 2: Allow the game to access your microphone

1. If COD: Vanguard is open, close the game entirely.
2. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .

 After you’ve done these, relaunch Vanguard to see if your voice chat works properly.

If this fix doesn’t do the trick, check out the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 The COD: Vanguard voice chat not working issue can also be triggered by a faulty or outdated audio driver. If you can’t remember the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now as this might solve your problem right away.

 There are mainly two ways to update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website for your headset and search for the most recent correct driver. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-scan-audio.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-update-all-realtek-audio.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your audio driver, restart your PC and check if your voice chat functions properly.

 If updating the audio driver doesn’t work for you, take a look at the next fix.
