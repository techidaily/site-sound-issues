 1) Press the **Windows logo key + R**  at the same time to open the Run dialog box.

 2) Click **Privacy** .  
  
![Privacy in Settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/privacy.png)

 3) Click **Microphone**  on the left pane. Then click on the **Change**  button and make sure **Microphone access for this device**  is turned on.  
  
![turn on app permissions on your microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/turn-on-app-permissions-for-your-micropho0ne.png)

 4) Under the **Allow apps to access your microphone**  section, make sure it’s turned **On** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 5) Once you’ve allowed the microphone to access your apps, you can change the settings for each app. Simply head to the **Choose which Microsoft apps can access your microphone** , and turn on apps you want to use with it. For desktop apps, make sure that **Allow desktop apps to access your microphone**  is turned **On** .

 After you’ve done all of these, try to use your webcam microphone and check if it’s working properly. If the issue persists, try the next fix below.

## 4\. Make sure your mic isn’t disabled

 Sometimes you may not notice that your microphone has accidentally been disabled. To check if that’s your case, take these steps:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-sound-settings.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) Under the **Input**  section, make sure that your device is showing. Then click **Device Properties** .  
  
![make sure your device isn't disabled](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Input-section-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Make sure the box next to**Disable** is unchecked.  
  
![make sure your device isn't disabled](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/make-sure-your-headset-isnt-disabled.png)

 After you’ve confirmed that the microphone is enabled, try to speak something to see if it’s now back to the normal state. If the microphone is still not working, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Set your device as default

 When you’re using an external camera, you might need to set that device as the audio device in order to access the built-in microphone. Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But sometimes it just fails to do that and you have to set it manually:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select **Open Sound settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/open-sound-settings.png)

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) Select the **Recording**  tab. Select your microphone and then click **Set Default > OK** .  
  
![set your device as the default](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/microphone.png)

 After applying changes, do a mic test to check if this method did the trick. If the microphone is still not working, you need to check the input sensitivity of your mic to ensure it is not too low or too high which could cause issues. Here’s how you can do this:

 1) In the Sound window (shown as the picture above), right-click the microphone and select**Properties** .

 2) Go to the**Levels** tab. Then, drag the slider to adjust the volume. While performing this step, you need to do a mic test at the same time.

## If your microphone is still not working properly…

 If nothing else helps and your microphone is still not working or you’re encountering some sound issues, give repairing your PC a try. It might be a system-level issue. By running a scan of your PC, you’ll be able to check if there are any corrupted system files and identify your issue easily without scratching your head.
