## 2\. Make sure your mic isn’t disabled

 Sometimes you may not notice that your microphone has accidentally been disabled, which can sometimes happen on Windows. To check if that’s your case, take these steps:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select**Open Sound settings** .

## 3\. Set your microphone device as default

 Normally, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But sometimes it just fails to do that and you have to set it manually:

 1) Right-click on the Speaker icon on the bottom-right corner of your screen. Then select**Open Sound settings** .

![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) Select the**Recording** tab. Select your microphone and then click**Set Default > OK** .

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 The mic on your RUNMUS gaming headsets won’t work correctly if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio driver. Outdated drivers can become incompatible with an update to Windows, or you may be lacking a new feature required for the microphone to function properly. In this case, you should update the driver and the issue can be resolved.

 You can update the audio driver from the PC or Device maker’s Support downloads web page. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 5\. Troubleshoot hardware issues

 If nothing else helps and your microphone is still not working, it’s likely that there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, do some basic checks as follows:

 1) Try plugging your headset into another microphone input jack in case the one you previously used is broken.

 2) Connect your headset to another device to check if it’s functioning properly. If it fails to work either, the issue may be on your headset. Then you should contact the RUNMUS or customer service for further assistance.
