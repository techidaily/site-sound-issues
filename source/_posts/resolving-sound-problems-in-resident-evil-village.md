### Fix 1: Troubleshoot hardware issues

 You can start troubleshooting the laptop no sound issue by ruling out the hardware errors.

Here is how to do it:

1. Make sure to check your speaker and headphone connections for loose cables or the wrong jack.

### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes you can’t hear sound from your speakers simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) Click **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

### Fix 4: Set default audio devices

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually.

To do so:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

### Fix 5: Disable audio enhancements

 Audio enhancements, as the name suggests, are features that allow for highest sound fidelity from your hardware. But depending on your configuration, they can also interfere with your system and trigger sound problems. So we should disable audio enhancements to see if it fixes the no sound on laptop problem.

Here’s how:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

 2) In the **Playback** tab, right-click on **your default audio device** and click **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd80da9483df.jpg)

 3) Click the **Enhancements** tab, then tick **the bo** x for **Disable all enhancements** and click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd80d9349581.jpg)

4) Test your audio device and see if the no sound issue is resolved.

 If all else fails, then nine times out of ten the problem lies with the audio device itself. You might want to contact the vendor of your laptop or the device manufacturer for further troubleshooting.
