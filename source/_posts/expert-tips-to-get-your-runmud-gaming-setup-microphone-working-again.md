1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.
2. Check if all your connections are rightly plugged in, including the extension cable connections. For the microphone, **ensure it’s plugged in all the way and not hanging loosely** .
