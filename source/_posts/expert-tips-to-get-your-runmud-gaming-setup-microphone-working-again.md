 Your HyperX cloud Stinger might be accidentally muted or not connected correctly. It’s worth checking the mute settings and the connectors of your headset to make sure they’re seated properly.

1. Make sure you use the included extension cable (splitter) with separate headphone and microphone jacks to connect Stinger to your PC headphone output and input ports.
2. Check if all your connections are rightly plugged in, including the extension cable connections. For the microphone, **ensure it’s plugged in all the way and not hanging loosely** .
3. Check the volume knob on the right ear and **make sure the mic is not muted or the volumes are not too low** .

1. Choose Apple menu ![](https://help.apple.com/assets/5E3B07C0094622B541F026E3/5E3B07C3094622B541F026EA/en_GB/2f77cc85238452e25cb517130188bf99.png) \>**System Preferences** , click**Sound** , then click**Input** .

## 5\. Close other apps that have access to your headset microphone

 If you have any audio software, especially that of your audio adapter, or you have third-party software such as Realtek software, disable these and make sure your operating system has the default control over your headphone.

 Also, shut down all other programs that utilize the headset microphone, including some communications apps such as Discord, Skype, Zoon, etc. VOIP (Voice Over IP) apps can play with your microphone settings on their own accord and prevent it from working properly.

## 6\. Check your HyperX Cloud Stinger in your game apps

 Sometimes the culprit may not be on your audio or control box settings, but in the game or app, you use instead. Check the audio settings in the game, or in the app, then confirm whether this will make your HyperX Cloud Stinger mic work again.

## 7\. Perform Windows Update

 Microsoft keeps releasing new updates constantly; usually, you would want to have the latest update for security and compatibility fixes. If you haven’t installed the latest update, be sure to do it for this might fix your problem.
