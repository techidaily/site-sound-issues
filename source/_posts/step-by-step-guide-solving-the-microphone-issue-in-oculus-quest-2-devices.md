## Fix the Quiet HDMI Dilemma: A Step-by-Step Solution for Restoring Audio From PC to Your Display/TV Devices

If you get**HDMI no sound** error in**Windows 10** , don’t worry. You’re not alone. Many Windows users have reported this issue. You can fix the error with one of the solutions below. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down at the top of the list until you find the one that works for you.

**Try these fixes, one at a time** :

1. [**Check if all hardware devices work properly**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Set HDMI Device as Default Device**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update the Sound Driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. **[Switch to ChromeOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Solution 1: Check if all hardware devices work properly

 Broken hardware devices probably cause HDMI not to work. So before moving on to other solutions, check if all hardware devices work properly:

 1.**Check if the cable has any problem.** Use another HDMI cable to see if the problem resolves.

 2.**Check if the output port works fine.** If your PC has multiple HDMI output ports, try different ports and see if the problem resolves.

 3.**Check if the monitor works properly.** Make sure the monitor’s speaker volume is not turned down or muted. Then try connecting the monitor to another PC.

## Solution 3: Update the Sound Driver

 Your HDMI no sound problem can be caused by corrupt or missing audio driver issues. To fix the problem, you can try to update the sound driver.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card, and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your sound card, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## Solution 4: Switch to ChromeOS

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ChromeOSDesktop.jpg)

 Windows is a very old technology. Sure, Windows 10 is relatively new, but it’s still just the latest iteration of a decades-old operating system, designed for a bygone era (pre-internet).

 Now that we have the internet, fast connection speeds, free cloud storage, and endless web apps (like Gmail, Google Docs, Slack, Facebook, Dropbox and Spotify), the entire Windows way of doing things – with locally installed programs and local file storage – is totally outdated.

 Why is that a problem? Because when you’re constantly installing uncontrolled third-party programs, you’re constantly opening the door to viruses and other malware. (And Windows’ insecure permission system compounds this problem.)

 Plus the way Windows manages installed software and hardware has always been a problem. If your computer shuts down unexpectedly, or a program installs, uninstalls or updates incorrectly, you can get ‘registry’ corruptions. That’s why Windows PCs always slow down and become unstable over time.

 Also because everything’s installed and saved locally, it doesn’t take long before you run out of disk space, and your disk gets fragmented, which makes everything even slower and more unstable.

 For most people, the simplest way to solve Windows problems is to ditch Windows altogether, and **switch to a faster, more reliable, more secure, easier to use and cheaper operating system…**

[Google ChromeOS.](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/)

 ChromeOS feels much like Windows, but instead of installing heaps of programs to email, chat, browse the internet, write documents, do school presentations, create spreadsheets, and whatever else you normally do on a computer, you use web apps. You don’t need to install anything at all.

 That means you don’t have virus and malware problems, and your computer doesn’t slow down over time, or become unstable.

And that’s just the start of the benefits…

 **To learn more about the benefits of ChromeOS, and to see comparison videos and demos,[visit GoChromeOS.com](https://www.google.com/chromebook/chrome-os/) .**

 Hope the instructions above helps you resolve the problem. If you have any questions or ideas, please feel free to leave your comments. I’d love to hear of any ideas or suggestions.
