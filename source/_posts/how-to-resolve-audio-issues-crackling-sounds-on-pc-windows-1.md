Are you facing no sound issues on Windows 11? Or maybe you’re suffering from the terrible audio sounds after updating to Windows 11\. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. I have encountered the same problem and hope this post would help you solve the issue as well.

Before you start, make sure your headset is working properly.

## Try these fixes

 These fixes have helped many people. Because of the different devices and environments, you may need to work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Enable Enhance audio**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your audio driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Realtek driver issue**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Update your Windows system**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Repair system files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## Fix 1: Enable Enhance audio

 If you have sound issues or can’t bear an awful sound that goes through your headset, this simple trick may help. We don’t know the mechanism behind the trick yet, but many users have proved it’s a working fix.

If this trick doesn’t work for you, please move to the next fix.

## Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The Windows 11 no sound issue and other audio issues are usually caused by drivers. Outdated drivers or missing drivers are the reason for many PC problems. To fix it, you need to find the latest and compatible driver for your devices.

 You can update the audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s official website and downloading the correct driver. Or, you can update the audio driver automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) if you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.
