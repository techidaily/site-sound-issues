### Method 2: Update your audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop the mic from working in Fortnite. You can try **updating your audio driver** to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver —**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your audio driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your audio driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf4e77d496c.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically.  (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb0550e404c0.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and check if your mic now works properly in Fortnite. If it doesn’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Method 3 below.

### Method 4: Allow apps to access your mic

 Many computers had a kind of privacy settings reset after a major**Windows 10** update in April 2018, which may have caused Fortnite unable to access your microphone. You can check for it through**Windows Settings** . Here’s how:

#### Windows 10

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Click**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf490b0f096.jpg)
3. In the left pane, click **Microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b88ebcdd1f01.jpg)
4. In the right pane, click the**Change** button, and you’ll see your mic is turned on. Also make sure**All apps to access your microphone** is enabled:  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf492ca1d0f.jpg)
5. In the section of**Choose which apps can access your microphone** , verify that**Fortnite is turned on** .
6. Test in Fortnite.

#### Windows 11

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + I keys**  simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Select **Privacy & security**  from the left panel. Then scroll down to the section **App permissions** , and click on **Microphone** .  
![windows 11 - Make sure apps have access to your microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Settings-Privacy-and-security-Microphone.jpg)
3. Toggle on **Microphone access** and **Let apps access your microphone** .  
![windows 11 - Make sure apps have access to your microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Microphone-access-and-Let-apps-access-your-microphone-On.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Also, make sure that you toggle on **Let desktop apps access your microphone** .  

![windows 11 - Make sure apps have access to your microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/win11-Let-desktop-apps-access-your-microphone-make-sure-its-On.jpg)
4. Now test your voice chat in-game.

### Method 5: Check for Windows updates

 If the above methods didn’t work for you, your**Fortnite mic not working** problem is probably being caused by**system issues** . Then, you can check for**Windows updates** .

1. Type**update** in the Windows search box, then press**Enter** .
2. Click**check for updates** in the pop-up window.
3. Install all identified updates to troubleshoot the issue.

**Note:** If you’re using a lower version of Windows,**updating your Window OS to Windows 10** might do the trick, which worked for some Windows 8 users.

 That’s it. You’re more than welcome to leave a comment below to share your results or any other suggestions.
