 One of the most common causes of Bluetooth not working problem is an outdated or faulty Bluetooth driver. If you never bother to or don’t remember when was the last time you updated your Bluetooth driver, definitely do it now. It might just fix your problem right away.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your Bluetooth driver: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your Bluetooth driver manually

### Option 2:Update your Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

## Fix 6: Repair your system files

 It’s possible that Bluetooth not working issue is caused by a Windows system error. Corrupt, damaged, or missing system files can cause Windows issues. To check if this is the exact cause, you can either use the Windows built-in tool to run a basic check or use an automatic tool to perform a complete diagnosis.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/windows-11-bluetooth-not-working/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fit for you.
* [Option 2 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there’re any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.
