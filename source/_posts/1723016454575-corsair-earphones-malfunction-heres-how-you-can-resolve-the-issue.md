## Corsair Earphones Malfunction? Here's How You Can Resolve the Issue

If you’re using a Corsair headset but it’s not working as expected, i.e. no sound or the microphone not functioning, you’re not alone. This type of issue is usually caused by the improper settings, an outdated audio driver or firmware. But don’t worry. This post will show you all the easy & quick solutions.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t need to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Troubleshoot hardware issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

5. **[Reinstall iCUE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you can do some troubleshooting via the steps below.

* **Test your Corsair on the other computer** to make sure it’s not physicially broken.

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

 In most cases, your Corsair headset will be set as default automatically once it’s connected properly. But if you’ve constantly changed between the headsets and speakers, the settings might be messed up. And you’ll need to configure the correct setup manually.

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-0.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** next to View by and click**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-1.jpg)
3. On the**Playback** tab, make sure your Corsair headset is enabled (covered with a green check mark). Then, click it and click**Set Default** .

 Once completed, check if your Corsair headset functions well. If not, try to troubleshoot the firmware.

## Fix 4 – Update the firmware

1. Connect your Corsair headset to the computer.
2. Launch iCUE. If you don’t have one, **[download it](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/icue)**  .
3. Navigate to the**Settings** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-1-1.jpg)
