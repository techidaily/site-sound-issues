## Troubleshooting and Repairing Your Stereo Audio Problems Quickly

Many Windows users are having issues with their**Stereo Mix** . Their Stereo Mix isn’t working properly and they can’t use it to record the audio they play on their computer and share it with their friends. This is a very annoying issue.

 If you’re also experiencing this Stereo Mix not working issue, don’t worry. The following are a few methods that have helped many users.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [**Make sure your computer sound is going through your sound card**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update your sound driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Enable Stereo Mix**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

##  Method 1: Make sure your computer sound is going through your sound card

 To ensure your Stereo Mix works well, all your audio output has to go through your sound card so that it can record the output. If your sound is sent around the sound card (using HDMI to output video and audio together, for example), your Stereo Mix is unable to work.

 To use Stereo Mix, you should make sure your computer sound is coming from your sound card. Connect your sound card directly to your speakers and set up the proper output. After that, check to see if your Stereo Mix works normally.
