## 1\. Try G435 on a different device

 When your G435 has no sound all of a sudden, the first thing to do is to see if the problem is with the headset itself, or with your computer settings. And the easiest way to do so is to use the headset on a different device.

 For instance, when you notice that your G435 doesn’t make any sound when on your computer, try to disconnect it from your current device, and try it on your phone, or another computer via Bluetooth or Lightspeed connection, and see if G435 works fine on a second device.

 If the same problem is seen on the second device, the problem could be with the headset itself. In that case, it’s always suggested to try it on a third device. If the Logitech G435 gaming headset doesn’t work either on 3 consecutive devices (computers, tablets, and/or mobile phones), it’s very likely that your headset is at fault. If so, you should talk to Logitech support to see if they can provide further support.

 If your Logitech G435 works fine on the other devices but your computer, please move on to the fixes below.

## 2\. Switch between Bluetooth and Lightspeed mode

 By switching between the Bluetooth connection mode and the Lightspeed mode, you can reset both connections and see if doing so will fix the G435 headset no sound issue.

To do so:

1. Press the Mute button for 3 seconds or longer.

2. Switch to LIGHTSPEED — the LED will light cyan for 5 seconds.

![](https://cx-assets.logi.com/CC%20Graphics/G435%20Headset/Switch4_3.jpg)

 See if G435 works fine under both modes. If the headset has no sound in either mode, please move on to the next fix.

## 3\. Remove and pair the G435 headset via Bluetooth again

 If your Logitech G435 headset still refuses to work at this stage, you can try to reconnect it to your computer.

 If you’re connecting the headset to your device via Lightspeed, just unplug the receiver from the USB port and then plug it back in.

 If your Logitech G435 headset is connected to your computer via Bluetooth, you should remove the headset first before you connect it again. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**I** key at the same time to open**Settings** . Select**Bluetooth & devices** \>**Devices** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-13.png)

## 6\. Update the Bluetooth and sound card drivers

 Outdated or incorrect sound card and Bluetooth adapter drivers could also be the culprit to the Logitech G435 having no sound problem, so if the above methods don’t help to bring back the sound, it’s likely that you have corrupted or outdated sound and Bluetooth drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. Update the firmware

 At this stage, you can try to update the G435 headset firmware to see if the new updates there will help to fix the no sound issue with the device for you.

 To do so, simply visit this webpage:[Download – G435 Gaming Headset](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-au/articles/4407898529687-Download-G435-Gaming-Headset) and see if the tool here is newer than the one you have.

 If there’s no new firmware available for your headset, please move on to the final fix.

---

## 9\. Repair system files

 If you are facing persistent issues with your Logitech G435 gaming headset and none of the previous solutions have proven effective, it’s possible that your corrupted system files are to blame. To rectify this, repairing the system files becomes crucial. The System File Checker (SFC) tool can assist you in this process. By executing the “sfc /scannow” command, you can initiate a scan that identifies problems and repairs missing or corrupted system files. However, it is important to note that   **the SFC tool primarily focuses on scanning major files and may overlook minor issues** .

 In situations where the SFC tool falls short, a more powerful and specialized Windows repair tool is recommended. **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is an automated Windows repair tool that excels in identifying problematic files and replacing malfunctioning ones. By scanning your PC comprehensively, Fortect can provide a more comprehensive and effective solution for repairing your Windows system.

To use Fortect to fix the G435 gaming headset no sound issue for you:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you**a detailed report of your PC status** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click**Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a**60-day Money-Back Guarantee** so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).
