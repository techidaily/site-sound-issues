## What if you can’t find the Enhancements tab?

 Some people might find out that their Enhancements tab is missing. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. The below fixes can help you get it back.

**Note:** Always check your hardware connections first. Unplug and replug sometimes can fix many problems.

 If this easy fix can’t help, then you can update/reinstall the audio driver.

### Fix 1: Update the audio driver

 The outdated or missing drivers may be the reason for the “Enhancements missing” problem. You can update your audio driver to solve the problem. There are two ways you can update your audio drivers.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can go to the [Realtek](http://www.realtek.com/downloads/) website, find the drivers for your system version and download them manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
