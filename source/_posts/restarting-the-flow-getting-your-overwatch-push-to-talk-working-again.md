### Fix 1: Make sure your mic is working

 Before attempting anything more complicated, you need to**make sure your microphone is functioning** . Check if your device is securely plugged into the correct port, and if the cable is in good condition. Also if you’re using a headset with a physical switch, make sure it’s turned on and set to a moderate volume. If possible, test your device on another computer.

### Fix 2: Check the sound settings on your PC

 Next make sure the mic is configured correctly on your computer. You can follow the steps below to check.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo button and the r button) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **ms-settings:sound** and click **OK** .

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 The voice chat issue could indicate that you’re using**faulty or outdated drivers** . We always recommend gamers to keep their driver up to date since it could help avoid tons of compatibility issues. In troubleshooting audio problems, you need to make sure you’re using the latest graphics and audio drivers. There’re 2 ways you can update your device drivers: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with your PC setup, you can try to update your drivers manually. First for your network and audio drivers, visit your motherboard manufacturer’s support website and search for your model. And for the GPU driver, simply go to your graphics card manufacturer’s download page:

* [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

 Then download the latest installer that’s compatible with your system.

#### Option 2: Update your drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating all the drivers, restart your computer and check if you can now talk in Rainbow Six Siege.

If the latest drivers didn’t help, you can try the next solution.

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 Usually Windows will download and install system updates automatically, but since it’s also a customizable feature, you should check for updates manually in troubleshooting.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 Once you’ve installed all the system updates, reboot your PC and test the mic in Rainbow Six Siege.

 If this fix doesn’t do the trick for you, simply move on to the next one.

### Fix 5: Set your in-game audio properly

 Next you should check if the in-game audio settings are misconfigured. You can use these steps to verify:

1. Launch Rainbow Six Siege and open**OPTIONS** .
2. Navigate to the**AUDIO** tab. Set**Master Volume** to a moderate value,**Voice Chat Volume** to max (100).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/r6-in-game-voice-chat-1.jpg)
3. You can set**Voice Chat Record Mode** to**Open** depending on your use case. Set**Voice Chat Record Level** to**100** , then choose a moderate value for**Voice Chat Record Threshold** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/r6-in-game-voice-chat-2.jpg)
4. Now return to your game and test the game chat.

 If changing the audio settings can’t get your chat working, you can continue to the next method.

### Fix 6: Check if it’s a server issue

 If none of the fixes above work for you, maybe you shouldn’t worry too much. According to some games, it might be just a server glitch. And feedback suggests that this error occurs occasionally. To find out if it’s simply a server issue, you can check the[Ubisoft Support Twitter](https://twitter.com/UbisoftSupport) for the latest information.
