### Fix 2: Update NVIDIA graphics driver

 In most cases, if this error persists, you may have faulty or outdated NVIDIA drivers installed. To fix it, you should update your NVIDIA graphics driver to the latest version. Although it seems like a sound card driver issue, many users solved the issue by updating their NVIDIA graphics driver.

 There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA drivers: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

#### Option 1: Manually

 To update your NVIDIA graphics driver manually, you’ll need to go to **[NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)**  of NVIDIA official website to download the latest & correct driver and install it manually.

1. After NVIDIA automatically detects your system and graphics card, click**Search** . (If not, you need to enter all required information.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/driver-downloads.jpg)
2. Click the**DOWNLOAD** button.
3. Double click the downloaded file and follow the onscreen instructions to extract it to your computer.

4. After performing the system check, select only**NVIDIA Graphics Driver** . Then click**AGREE AND CONTINUE** .

5. Select**Custom(Advanced)** \>**NEXT** .

6. Be sure to tick the box next to**Perform a clean installation** , then click**NEXT** .  
 (You can uncheck the software you don’t need.)

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
8. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 NVIDIA outputs should be showing normally now. If not, you can try the next fix.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
