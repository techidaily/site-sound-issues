### Fix 3: Install the latest Fortnite patch

 The developers of Fortnite release regular game patches to fix bugs. It’s possible that a recent patch has stopped your chat from working, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If you run**Fortnite** from the **Epic Games Launcher** , you can follow the instructions below to check for the latest Fortnite patch:

1\. Run the Epic Games Launcher.

 2\. On the left panel, click **Library** . On the right, click **the gear button** on the lower-right corner of **Fortnite** .

 Run Fortnite again to check whether your chat problem has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to Fix 4, below.

### Fix 4: Make sure your microphone is on for Fortnite

 If you downloaded Fortnite from**the Microsoft Store** , check if it has permission to use your microphone. Here’s how to do it:

 1\. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap427.jpg)

 2\. Click **Microphone**  on the left pane, and make sure**Microphone access for this device** is**on** , and the status is **On** for **Fortnite** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap428.jpg)

3\. Run Fortnite to see if chat works now. If not, try Fix 5, below.

### Fix 5: Check your audio settings

 Windows and Fortnite both have audio settings, and sometimes things just get a little mixed up. So it can help to reset everything, manually, to clear out the cobwebs. (Kinda like how restarting your PC can sometimes mysteriously resolve problems.) Here is how to do it:

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.

 i. In Fortnite, click**the menu button** in the upper-right corner, then click**the gear icon** to open the game settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Snap925.png)

 ii. Click**the speaker icon** to view the audio settings. Then**turn off Voice Chat** and click**Apply** .

 2\. On your desktop,**right-click** **the speaker icon** at the bottom-right corner, and then select**Sounds** .

 3\. Click the **Playback** tab, select the speakers/headphones you’re using and click **Set Default** .
