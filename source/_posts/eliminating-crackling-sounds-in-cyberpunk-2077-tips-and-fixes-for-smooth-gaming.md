### Fix 2 – Change USB port

 Cyberpunk 2077 audio not working properly might be caused by a faulty headphone port.

If sound crackling persists, take a look at the solutions below.

### Fix 3 – Adjust the sound settings

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 The audio issues of Cyberpunk 2077 may indicate your audio driver is wrong, faulty or outdated. To improve the audio quality and enjoy the stunning sound effect of Cyberpunk 2077, you should install the latest audio driver.

There are two ways for you to do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver manually by going to the sound card manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.
