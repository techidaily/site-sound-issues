### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or itâ€™s out of date. So you should update your audio driver to see if it fixes your problem. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

Or if you just want to update the audio driver, simply click the **Update** button next to it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-36.png)

### Fix 3: Make sure your microphone is set as default in Windows

 Ideally Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default device every time itâ€™s plugged into. But thatâ€™s not always the case and sometimes youâ€™ll have to manually set it as default.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](http://twitter.com/home/?status=How%20To%20Fix%20Fortnite%20Sound%20Not%20Working%20-%20https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-fortnite-sound-not-working-on-pc/) **[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

Hereâ€™s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and R at the same time, then type **ms-settings:sound** and press **Enter** to open Control Panel.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-239.png)

 4) In **Sound** settings, scroll down to the**Input** section, and in**Choose your input device** , make sure the microphone you are actively using is selected. Then,**test your microphone** by speaking into your mic to see if it â€˜hearsâ€™ anything. If yes, it means you have configured the microphone properly.

### Fix 5: Install the latest game patch

 The developers of Apex Legends, EA, keep releasing game patches to fix bugs. Itâ€™s possible that a recent patch has stopped your game from running smoothly, and that a new patch is required for the problem. So itâ€™s recommended that you go to[**EA official website**](https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends) , check for the latest patch, download and install it. Then check if it fixes the voice chat not working problem.

 If there is no patches available, or the patch fails to address the problem, then please try **Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Reinstall Origin and Apex Legends

Here are the steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **appwiz.cpl** and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-174.png)
