 Before moving on to some more advanced methods, you need to make sure your microphone is not physically broken and the connection works fine. You can take these steps to do a basic check:

* Simply**unplug and replug your headset** into the computer to see if everything goes back to normal.
* **Connect your headset to another machine** to check if it functions well. If not, it’s likely your device is physically damaged and you should take it for repair or replacement.

 If you’ve done a quick check and confirmed there is no hardware issue, the cause may be related to the computer settings. Keep reading to find more solutions below.

### Fix 2 – Check your privacy settings

 To allow your headset mic to work on the PC, you should enable the necessary access so that your system and apps can use the microphone properly. Here’s how:

1. In the Windows search box, type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .

 After applying the settings, you can restart Rec Room to test the issue. If it’s not resolved, try the next fix.

### Fix 3 – Set your headset mic as the default device

 There are some occasions that your primary headset mic is not automatically set as default, and thus you’ll find it doesn’t work with Rec Room. To tweak the settings manually, follow the steps:

#### On the PC sound settings

1. In the Windows search box, type**control panel** and select**Control Panel** from the result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/control-panel-0.jpg)
2. Select**Small icons** from the menu next to View by and click**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2-4.jpg)
3. Go to the**Recording** tab. Then right-click other recording devices you’re not using and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-settings-2.jpg)
4. Make sure your preferred headset mic is**enabled** , which should be covered with a green check mark, and**set as default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-5.jpg)

#### On Oculus or SteamVR

 Then you’ll need to set your mic as default in Oculus or SteamVR app.

**Oculus**

1. Launch the Oculus app and click the**gear icon** at the top right.
2. Select**Devices** from the left pane.
3. Click**Rift** .
4. Under Audio Input in VR, choose**Rift microphone** from the drop-down menu, and turn up the volume.

**SteamVR**

1. Open SteamVR and click the**icon at the top left corner** and select **Settings** .
2. Select the**Audio** tab. Then click**Set Record Device** and set it to your preferred headset mic.

 See if your microphone works in Rec Room. If not, continue to the next method below.

### Fix 4 – Update your audio driver

 If you’ve been constantly running into mic not working with Rec Room or other apps, chances are that your audio driver is faulty or out-of-date. In this case, you should update the driver to keep your VR rig up and running, and there are two ways for you:

**Manually** : You can update your audio driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your device, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically (recommended)** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your VR headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 5 – Close unnecessary background apps

 If you’re running multiple programs in the background, they might use your headset microphone, and thus prevent it from working with Rec Room. To see if that’s the cause, simply disable all unnecessary apps via the following steps:

1. Right-click any empty space on your taskbar and select**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-10.jpg)
2. Right-click each application you want to close and click**End task** .

 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 Your Rec Room mic should be working normally now without other interruptions. If you’ve attempted all the fixes above but to no avail, you may want to**reinstall Rec Room** to solve potential program glitches.
