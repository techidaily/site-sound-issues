### Fix 1: Check the connection issue

 To use your scanner, you need to make sure that your scanner is**powered on** in the first place.

 Then you should check the**connection** **issue** . If you’re using a USB scanner, check the**USB ports** and**USB cables** to ensure it works properly. While you’re using a network scanner, ensure your computer has a good**Internet** **connection** , and your scanner connects to your computer under the Internet. In addition, if you’re using **[VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  on your computer, try**disconnecting VPN** from your computer and scanning again.

 If you’ve checked the above steps and your HP scanner still doesn’t work, don’t worry. There is something else to try.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the**Run** box.
2. Type**services.msc** and click**OK** .

 There are two ways to update your scanner driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update scanner driver** – You can go to the website of your scanner manufacturer, find the latest driver for your scanner, and install it on your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

### Fix 5: Run System File Checker

 System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in Windows feature that scans corrupted system files and repairs it automatically.

 Your HP scanning is not working because of some corrupted system files, so you can try SFC to fix the problem.

1. Type**cmd** in the search box, right-click Command Prompt, and select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd0319454560.jpg)
2. In Command Prompt, type the following command, then press**Enter** .  
sfc /scannow  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd031d993e59.jpg)
3. Then wait for**Verification 100% complete** . This can take a while.
4. Once complete, Type**exit** in Command Prompt and press**Enter** to close the window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd036dad46be.jpg)

Restart your computer and see if your scanner begins to work.

 However, sometimes the System File Checker may fail to detect critical or even some minor issues. If running the tool didn’t give you any luck, you should use a more powerful tool such as **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a more powerful tool that scans your computer for invalid registry issues, fragmented files, and Windows tweaks.

To fix your issues, follow the steps below to run a full scan of your PC:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)
