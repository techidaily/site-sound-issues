### Fix 4: Make sure your microphone is on for Fortnite

 If you downloaded Fortnite from**the Microsoft Store** , check if it has permission to use your microphone. Here’s how to do it:

 1\. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Privacy** .

 1\. Temporarily**turn off** voice chat in Fortnite.
