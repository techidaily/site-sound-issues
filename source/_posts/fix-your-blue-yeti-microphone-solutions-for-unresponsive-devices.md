Hopefully this fixes your microphone issue. But if not, there are still three fixes you can try.

## Method 2: Check your microphone device settings

Your Logitech G933 mic may be disabled or not set as the default device on your computer. Or the microphone volume is set to a very low value so it can’t record your sound clearly. To check these settings:**1) Hold down the Windows logo** **key** and**press the R** **key**on your keyboard at the same time to bring up the Run dialog, then type “_**control**_” and press **Enter**.

**2)** In Control Panel, select**Large icons**from the**View by**drop down menu.

## Method 3: Update your audio drivers

The mic on your Logitech G933 headset won’t work if you’re using an incorrect or outdated audio or headset driver. So you should update the driver to see if that fixes the issue.  You can update your driver manually or automatically. The manual process is time consuming, technical and risky, so we won’t cover it here. Nor do we recommend it unless you have excellent computer knowledge.  Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is very easy. Simply install and run [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/), and it will automatically find all the devices on your PC that need new drivers, and install them for you. Here’s how to use it. **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)and install**Driver Easy**.**2)** Run**Driver Easy**and click the **Scan Now**button.**Driver Easy**will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4dc0b9d2848.jpg)

**3)** Click the**Update**button next to your sound device or your headset to download the latest and correct driver for it.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4dbe76cbcd6.jpg)

You can also click the **Update All**button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer. (This requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) — if you don’t already have it, you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All**.) Once you’ve updated the driver for your Logitech G933 headset, restart your computer. Then log in again and see if the microphone is working.

### Method 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues

If your headset microphone is still not working, it’s likely there are hardware issues with your computer or your headset. In this case, there are a few things you need to do. First, try connecting your headset to**another port**on your computer. This will resolve any problems you might be experiencing due to the port you’re using. If changing the port doesn’t work for you, connect your headset to**another computer**and see if this fixes your microphone. If it does, then you should contact the vendor of your computer for advice. If nothing above helps you, the issues may be on your headset. Then you should contact Logitech for support or have your headset serviced.
