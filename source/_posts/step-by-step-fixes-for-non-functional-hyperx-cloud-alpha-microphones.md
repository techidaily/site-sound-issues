## 1\. Set your microphone as the default device

 Oftentimes, when your microphone is connected, Windows can automatically detect it and set it as the default input device. But you may have multiple input or recording devices connected. It would occur to you that your computer is using another device instead of the one you’re attempting to use. In order to set your Redragon microphone as your input device, follow the instructions below:

 1) At the bottom-right corner of your taskbar, right-click your speaker icon and select **Open Sound settings** .  
  
![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-sound-settings-1.png)

 2) Scroll down to the section of **Related Settings** and click **Sound Control Panel** .  
  
![Open Sound Control Panel](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/sound-control-panel.png)

 3) When the Sound window opens, select the **Recording**  tab. Click on your microphone and then click **Set Default > OK** .

## 2\. Turn on app permissions for your microphone

 Normally, when your headset is plugged in, your system will detect it and your apps can access the microphone. But for some reasons, it may fail to do that. To check if your apps have access to your microphone, follow these steps:

 1) Press the **Windows + R keys**  simultaneously to open the Run box.

 2) Click **Privacy** .

 4) Under the **Allow apps to access your microphone**  section, make sure it’s turned **On** .  
  
![allow apps to access your microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/allow-apps-to-access-your-microphone.png)

 5) Once you’ve allowed microphone access to your apps, you can change the settings for each app. Simply head to the **Choose which Microsoft apps can access your microphone** , and turn on apps you want to use with it. For desktop apps, make sure that **Allow desktop apps to access your microphone**  is turned **On** .

 After you’ve done these, do a mic test. If it’s not functioning, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Update your audio driver

 Your audio driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the sound card. If it is outdated or misconfigured, it would cause noticeable performance problems. To solve your problems, you need to update your audio driver.
