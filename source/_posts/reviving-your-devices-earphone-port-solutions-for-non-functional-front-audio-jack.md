## Beyond The Wire Microphone Malfunction Solutions: Making Your Microphone Work Again

2. **[Allow the game to access your microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Configure the sound settings correctly](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Run Beyond The Wire as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Restart your game

 If your microphone accidentally disconnects during the play sessions, it may stop working until you restart the game completely. Make sure the microphone is securely connected and then restart Beyond The Wire to see if everything goes back to normal. If not, go ahead with the next fix, below.
