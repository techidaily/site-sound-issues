### Fix 6: Close conflicting software

 Some players reported that they managed to get the sound back by closing programs that have audio output. You can try this method by closing apps such as**Discord** ,**Skype** and**Chrome** , as they might affect the in-game audio.

### Fix 7: Change your audio channel

 In some cases, output devices with some high-end features (e.g. 5.1 surround sound) might not work so well on your system, so you’ll need to change your audio channel for the audio output. This solution also apply to the case where players have only cinematic music and no sound effects.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On the lower-right corner of your desktop, right-click the**volume icon** and select**Sound** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Snap106.jpg)
