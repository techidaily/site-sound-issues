 Click on the gear icon at the bottom-left corner next to your username.

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 Audio issues can arise if you’re using an**outdated audio driver** . To fix the Discord echo problem, you should give updating the audio driver a try. This may be the best shot you can take without much troubleshooting.
