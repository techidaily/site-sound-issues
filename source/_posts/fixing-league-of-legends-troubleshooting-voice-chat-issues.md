 Here are four fixes that have helped other users resolve the voice chat not working problem in LoL. You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

### Fix 1: Check out the obvious

 Whether it is that you cannot hear your friends, or you can’t get heard, the first thing you should check is whether your headset is connected properly.

 You should make sure the volume is set to an audible level, check that the cables (if you have a wired headphone device) are not worn out or loosely connected, and ensure that they’re plugged into the right port etc.

 Once you have double-checked these items, test the voice chat feature in LoL to see if it works. If yes, then great! If the problem persists, please move on to**Fix 2** below.

### Fix 2: Join voice channel automatically

 You may experience the sound not working in LoL if you disable the in-game sounds during some game session without you noticing it. So make sure to enable Join voice channel automatically to turn on the in-game sound.  
 Here is how to do it:

1. Open League of Legends client.
2. In the upper right corner, click**Settings** (the cog icon).
