7. **[Change your audio channel](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1:**Check if it’s a video problem**

 There are many reasons why a Facebook video has no sound, and the most common one is that the video is incorrectly encoded, or is silent at the first place. In that case, you can try other videos and see if they have audio issues as well.

 Also don’t forget to check the video volume control in Facebook. It pops up at the bottom when you hover your mouse cursor over the video. Make sure you set the video volume correctly.

 If the volume is set correctly and your no sound issue reappears on other videos, please move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2:**Unmute your browser**

 Your browser won’t make any sound when it’s muted, whether deliberately or accidentally. You can follow these steps to check:

 The screenshots below come from Windows 10, and this method also applies to Windows 8.1 and Windows 7.

1. On the lower-right corner of your desktop, right-click the**volume icon** and select**Open Volume mixer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/open-volume-mixer.jpg)
2. In the Volume Mixer window,**hold and drag** the slider for your browser (mine is Chrome) to turn up the volume.

3. Play your video and see if you hear any sound.

 If this method doesn’t fix your problem, please take a look at the next one.

### Fix 3: **Change to another browser**

 If you’ve installed plugins on your current web browser, try playing the same video on another browser. Some**browser extensions** can mute tabs and some might cause your browser to function incorrectly. If the problem doesn’t occur on another browser, try disabling all the plugins on the previous browser and test again.

 For a better testing result, you should stop using Internet Explorer and shift to other modern counterparts, such as[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) ,[Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and[Opera](https://www.opera.com/) .

 If the problem persists after changing your browser, please move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4:**Restart your computer**

 It may sound silly, but rebooting your computer actually solves many problems. Especially when you’ve kept your PC running for a long period, and some programs start to function improperly. In all cases, a restart resets the current state of a software, and it might just fix your no sound issue at the same time.

 If restarting your computer doesn’t help either, please continue to the next method below.

### Fix 5:**Update your audio driver**

 Sound problems can occur when you’re using a faulty or outdated audio driver. That’s why we always recommend keeping your drivers up to date. Driver updates provide security patches and feature enhancements, and it usually fixes many strange and stubborn issues.

 There are mainly 2 ways you can update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 To update your audio driver manually, first go to your motherboard manufacturer’s website and search for your model. Audio drivers are usually located in the**Support** or**Download** page, with a name similar to “**Realtek HD Driver** “. Remember to choose only the installer that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact sound device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-realtek-audio-driver.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**
