### Fix 1:**Check your audio input device**

 There’re many reasons for microphone problems, but the first thing you should do when troubleshooting is to**check the physical connections** . Make sure the cables of your microphone are securely plugged into the**correct audio jack** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Also check if your**cable** is damaged. If your microphone or headset has a**mute switch** , make sure it’s unmuted. You can also try plugging in the cable again to see if it gives you any luck, or you can use your cellphone or another computer for audio testing.

 If there’s nothing wrong with your input device, check out the next method.

## Fix 2: Configure your system microphone settings

 Normally when you plugged in your microphone, Windows will set it as the default recording device. But that’s not always the case. Sometimes you’ll need to configure this setting manually.

You can use these steps to check:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box. Type or paste**ms-settings:sound** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-ms-settings-sound.jpg)
2. Under the**Input** section, make sure your input device is set to the desired one. Then click**Device properties and test microphone** .

3. Make sure you’ve**unchecked the box** next to**Disable** , and the slider under the**Volume** section is set to**100** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/device-properties-and-test-microphone.jpg)
4. Click**Start test** and tap or speak to your microphone. Then click**Stop test** . If you’re prompted**The highest value we saw was xx percent** , it means your microphone is working correctly.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/test-mic-new.jpg)
5. Launch World of Warcraft and test your in-game voice chat.

 If this method doesn’t tackle your problem, please continue to the next one.

### Fix 3:**Check your in-game settings**

 If your microphone is working outside the game, you should check if you’ve configured the in-game settings correctly.

Here’re the steps:

1. Open the**Blizzard client** . On the top left corner, click the**Blizzard icon** and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blizzard-client.jpg)
2. On the menu to your left, select**Voice Chat** . Set**OUTPUT DEVICE** and**INPUT DEVICE** to**System Default Device** . Then click**Done** .

### Fix 4:**Update your audio driver**

 The voice chat issue could occur when you’re using a**faulty or outdated audio driver** . You should be sure that you’re using the latest audio driver, especially when you’ve spend top dollar for your peripherals, which often ship with edgy features that need to be unlocked by additional drivers.

 You can do this manually, if you like, by visiting each manufacturer’s download page, finding the right drivers, etc. But that takes time and computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-audio-bluetooth-usb-unifying.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your audio driver, restart your computer and check the voice chat in WoW.

 If updating the audio driver failed to solve your case, simply move on to the next method.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 includes 2 types of updates, which respectively offer security patches and a performance boost. Sometimes Windows updates fix the software or driver conflict automatically. Given this, your voice chat issue could be easily solved by updating your system.

By the way, it’s surprisingly easy to update too:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate** , then press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-windows-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then search and install the system updates automatically. Once it’s done, restart your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed**all** the system updates, repeat these steps until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click**Check for updates** .

 If your issue persists after installing system updates, please continue to the final fix.

### Fix 6: Scan and repair WoW

 This issue might occur when you have some game components missing. To check the integrity of your game files, simply follow these steps:

1. Open your Blizzard client and select**World of Warcraft** . Then click**Options** and select**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blizzard-wow-scan-and-repair-1.jpg)
2. It will take**5-30 minutes** to verify the integrity of your game files. Once completed, launch WoW and check your in-game voice chat.
