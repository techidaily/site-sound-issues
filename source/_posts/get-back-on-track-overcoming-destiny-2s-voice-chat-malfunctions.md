### Fix 2: Update your audio driver

 The voice chat not working issue can be caused by a corrupted or outdated audio driver. To fix it, you’ll need to update your audio driver.

 One way to do that is to visit your device manufacturer’s website and search for your model, then manually download and install the most recent audio/sound drivers for your device. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
