To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) Click **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .
