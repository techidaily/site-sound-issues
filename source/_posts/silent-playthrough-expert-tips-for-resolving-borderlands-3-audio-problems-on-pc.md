### Fix 2: Make sure the volume is audible

 Sometimes you can’t hear sound from your speakers simply because the volume is mute or set too low.

To make sure the volume is audible:

 1) Click **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your screen, then move **the volume slider** all the way to at least halfway up.If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.

 If there’s a volume control on the app you’re playing, make sure to slide the volume bar to an audible level too.

 2) Test if you can hear any sound from your Lenovo laptop. If not, then move on to **Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 4) **Restart** your computer and test if you get sound back on your Lenovo laptop. If yes, then congrats! If the no sound issue persists, please move on to**Fix 3** , below.

### Fix 4: Set default audio devices

 Ideally when a new audio device is inserted, Windows will automatically set it as the default audio playback device. But that’s not always the case and sometimes we’ll have to set default devices manually.

To do so:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd7f6955a2d7.jpg)

 2) In the **Playback** tab, click on **the audio device you wish to play** , then click **Set Default** . Click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd7f797e4504.jpg)

 If **the audio device you’re to play** doesn’t show up in the device list, and right-click on **the empty space** and tick **Show Disabled Devices** . Then right-click on **the device** once it appears and click **Enable** before you do step **2)** .

 3) Check to see if your Lenovo no sound problem has been fixed. If yes, then great! But if it’s still no joy, please move on to**Fix 5,** below.

### Fix 5: Disable audio enhancements

 Audio enhancements, as the name suggests, are features that allow for highest sound fidelity from your hardware. But depending on your configuration, they can also interfere with your system and trigger sound problems. So we should disable audio enhancements to see if it fixes the no sound on laptop problem.

Here’s how:

 1) Right-click on **the sound icon** on the lower-right of your computer screen, then click **Sounds** .

 2) In the **Playback** tab, right-click on **your default audio device** and click **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bd80da9483df.jpg)

 3) Click the **Enhancements** tab, then tick **the bo** x for **Disable all enhancements** and click **OK** .

4) Test your audio device and see if the no sound issue is resolved.
