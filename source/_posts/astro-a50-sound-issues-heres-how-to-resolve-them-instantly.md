## Fix 1: Troubleshoot the connection

 The first thing you need to try is to make sure the headset’s volume wheel is set to a reasonable value.

 Then, you need to check if the Base Station and your headset are synced together.

1. Ensure the Mode Switch on the Base Station is set to the right device (PC or PS4).
2. Place A50 headset on the Base Station, and make sure it’s seated correctly.
3. Once synced together, you will see the LED lights on the front of the Base Station will starting Blinking.
4. Make sure the optical cable is fully plugged into the “**MICRO USB** ” and the other end of the cable is plugged firmly into the USB port of your PC.

5. Ensure that the game voice balance on the right ear cup of the headset is somewhere in the middle.

 When the connections are fine, but the Astro A50 no sound issue persists, you can try the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Option 2: Update your sound card driver automatically (Recommended)

 If the sound problem only happens in a certain application or game, please make sure the audio is configured correctly.

 But your Astro 50 no sound issue persists whatsoever, you can try connecting your headset to another computer and see if it’s working properly. If it does, then you should[contact Astro Support](https://www.astrogaming.com/en-us/support.html) for further troubleshooting steps or have your headset replaced.
