## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot the hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you should perform some simple troubleshooting steps. Here’s how:

* **Double-check the connection** . You should see two input jacks on your headset, one for the cable connected to the PC and the other for the microphone. Make sure you plug in the microphone securely and also press your PC connectivity cable into the correct jack harder until you feel two firm clicks.

* **Connect your headset to another computer** to test. If it fails to work either, chances are the headset is physically damaged, and you should contact Logitech for further assistance.

## Fix 2 – Allow access to your Logitech G Pro X microphone

 Windows 10 and 11 allow users to control whether the system and apps can use their microphones. So if you’ve disabled the access, your Logitech G Pro X mic won’t work properly. To grant the permission, follow the steps:

**On Windows 11:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-25.png)
2. Make sure**Microphone access** and**Logitech G Pro X** are both set to**On** .

**On Windows 10:**

1. In the search box, type**microphone privacy** and click**Microphone privacy settings** .

2. Click the**Change** button and**turn on** the Microphone access for this device.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/microsoft-team-control-panel.jpg)

3. Navigate to the**Recording** tab, and make sure your Logitech G Pro X headset microphone is**enabled** (there should be a green checkmark). Then, click the microphone and click**Set Default** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-5.jpg)
4. Right-click the microphone and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-6.jpg)
5. Go to the**Levels** tab. Then,**drag the volume slider to the max** and click**OK** .

 Now that your Logitech Pro X microphone is set as default and the volume is turned up, test the issue again. If this method doesn’t help, proceed to the next one.
