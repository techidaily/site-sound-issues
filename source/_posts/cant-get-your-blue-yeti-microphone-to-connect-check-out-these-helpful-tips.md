### Fix 1\. Try another USB port/cable

 First, to rule out a hardware issue, you can try another USB port and make sure your USB cable is properly connected. Check whether your microphone goes back to work. Many users find it works when they switch the USB port from 3.0 to 2.0.

 If Blue Yeti is still not showing up on your PC, you can try another USB cable. You can easily get a[**replacement cable**](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Snowball-Product-Picture-Compatibility/dp/B08JG1SNB7?tag=drivereasycom-20) at Amazon. Check that the status light is illuminated.

### Fix 2\. Update the microphone driver

 If there’s nothing wrong with your hardware, the culprit might be your software. When the related driver software gets corrupted or outdated, your Blue Yeti microphone won’t be recognized.

There are mainly two methods for you to fix this driver issue:

#### Option 1 –**Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you’re not confident playing with device drivers, you can update the driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your sound card and Blue Yeti microphone, and it will download and install them correctly.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

#### Option 2 –**Manually**

 Updating the Blue Yei microphone driver manually, on the other hand, takes time and patience. If you’re ready for this, here’s how:

1) Make sure your Blue Yeti microphone is properly connected.

2) On your keyboard, press**Win + R** at the same time to open the**Run** box.

3) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

![devmgmt.msc](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/devmgmt.msc_.jpg)

 4) Expand the**Sound, video and game controllers** category, check if your Blue Yeti device is listed there.

 5) If so, right-click it and select**Uninstall** . When prompted, tick the box next to**Delete the driver software for this device** and click**Uninstall** . Wait for the process to complete. This may take a few seconds.

 If updating failed, you can try uninstalling the USB driver, and scan for hardware changes.

### Fix 3\. Show disabled devices in settings

 It’s likely that your Blue Yeti is not set as the default recording device. Here’s how to troubleshoot this issue:

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win + R** , and then enter**mmsys.cpl** in the Run box.

 2) Select the**Recording** tab.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/recording-tab.jpg)

 3) Check if the**Blue Yeti Microphone** is listed. If so, you need to set Blue Yeti as your default device. But if not, you can right-click the empty space and select**Show Disabled Devices** and**Show Disconnected Devices** .
