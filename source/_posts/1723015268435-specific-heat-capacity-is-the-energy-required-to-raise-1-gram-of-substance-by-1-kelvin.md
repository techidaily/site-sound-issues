## Unlock the Secret to Transmitting In-Game Noise via Discord - Fixed

Itâ€™s annoying that your Discord is picking up game audio all of a sudden. But youâ€™re not alone here. Many gamers have been reporting the same issue. The good news is that you can fix it easily.

**Why is Discord picking up the game audio?**

* **Wrong connection type:** Itâ€™s recommended to plug your headphone into the correct USB port, instead of the USB port in your keyboard.
* **Outdated audio drivers** : Itâ€™s possible that an outdated or corrupt audio driver is causing your Discord to pick up the game audio.
* **Sound settings:** Another possible cause of Discord picking up game audio is that your microphone is not set as the default input device.

## How to fix Discord audio issues?

* [1. Update audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [2. Change sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3. Reinstall Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### 1\. Update audio drivers

 A properly working audio driver can make sure your device is working normally. If your Discord picks up the game audio, it might be caused by a malfunctioning audio driver. To make sure your audio works fine, you should update your audio driver:

Thereâ€™re mainly two ways for you to update an audio driver:

**Manually â€“** You will need to open Device Manager to expand the Sound, video, and game controllers list, right-click your sound card, and select**Update driver** \>**Search automatically for updated driver software** . You can let Windows update the driver for you, but if it doesnâ€™t work, you can uninstall the driver and restart your PC, or visit your device manufacturerâ€™s website and install the most recent audio/sound drivers for your device.

**Automatically â€“** Updating your driver automatically, on the other hand, is quite easy â€“ all done in a few clicks with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You can choose to do it with our FREE Version or purchase the **[Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to unlock more advanced features.
