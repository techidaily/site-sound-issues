## Corsair Earphones Malfunction? Here's How You Can Resolve the Issue

If you’re using a Corsair headset but it’s not working as expected, i.e. no sound or the microphone not functioning, you’re not alone. This type of issue is usually caused by the improper settings, an outdated audio driver or firmware. But don’t worry. This post will show you all the easy & quick solutions.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t need to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Troubleshoot hardware issues](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check the sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update the firmware](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall iCUE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1 – Troubleshoot hardware issues

 Before trying anything more complicated, you can do some troubleshooting via the steps below.

* **Test your Corsair on the other computer** to make sure it’s not physicially broken.
* Repair the connection. Simply**replug the Corsair headset** into your PC and**try another USB port** .

## Fix 3 – Check the sound settings

1. In the Windows search box, type**control** and select**Control Panel** .

## Fix 4 – Update the firmware

2. Launch iCUE. If you don’t have one, **[download it](https://www.corsair.com/ww/en/icue)**  .
3. Navigate to the**Settings** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-1-1.jpg)
