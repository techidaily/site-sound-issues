### Fix 2: Update NVIDIA graphics driver

 In most cases, if this error persists, you may have faulty or outdated NVIDIA drivers installed. To fix it, you should update your NVIDIA graphics driver to the latest version. Although it seems like a sound card driver issue, many users solved the issue by updating their NVIDIA graphics driver.

 There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA drivers: **[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

#### Option 1: Manually

 To update your NVIDIA graphics driver manually, you’ll need to go to **[NVIDIA Driver Downloads](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us)**  of NVIDIA official website to download the latest & correct driver and install it manually.

1. After NVIDIA automatically detects your system and graphics card, click**Search** . (If not, you need to enter all required information.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/driver-downloads.jpg)
2. Click the**DOWNLOAD** button.
3. Double click the downloaded file and follow the onscreen instructions to extract it to your computer.

4. After performing the system check, select only**NVIDIA Graphics Driver** . Then click**AGREE AND CONTINUE** .

5. Select**Custom(Advanced)** \>**NEXT** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/installation-options.jpg)
6. Be sure to tick the box next to**Perform a clean installation** , then click**NEXT** .  
 (You can uncheck the software you don’t need.)

7. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
8. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 NVIDIA outputs should be showing normally now. If not, you can try the next fix.

 If you don’t have the time or patience to play with drivers manually, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the correct drivers for your device.

**All the drivers in Driver Easy** **come straight from** **the manufacturer** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

3. Click the**Update** button next to your sound card driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
