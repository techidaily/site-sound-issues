### Fix 2: Configure your device properly

 Next you need to make sure your output device is set to the desired one, and all the related settings should be configured correctly. If you don’t know how, you can follow these steps:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo button and the r button) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste **ms-settings:sound** and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/run-ms-settings-sound.jpg)
2. Under the**Input** section, make sure your input device is set to the one you’re using. Then click**Device properties and test microphone** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/input-device-testing.jpg)
3. Make sure the box next to**Disable** is unchecked, and the slider under**Volume** is set to**100** .

4. Now you can check the in-game audio.

 If there’s nothing wrong with your settings, or you can hear the computer sound everywhere except in Black Ops Cold War, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 One of the most common causes of sound issues is that you’re using**a faulty or outdated audio driver** . New drivers tend to have better compatibility that the legacy ones provided by Windows. So if you haven’t updated your audio driver, definitely do it now.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your audio driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your audio driver manually

 This requires a certain level of computer knowledge. If you know the specifications of your PC, you can try to update your audio driver manually.

 You can do this by visiting the website of your motherboard manufacturer, then search for your exact model. When you find your motherboard, go to its support page and download the driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your audio driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 4: Install all Windows updates

 Besides drivers, you should also make sure that your system is up to date. Windows updates provide bugs fixes and performance boosts that might cure some strange issues.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update.jpg)
3. Click**Windows Update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

After rebooting your PC, return to Black Ops Cold War and test the audio.

### Fix 5: Check your in-game audio settings

 If you’ve tried all the fixes above but to no avail, you need to take a look at your in-game settings. Faulty audio settings could also lead to no sound issues in Black Ops Cold War.

Here’s what you should check:

1. Open Black Ops Cold War and go to**Settings** .
2. Navigate to the**AUDIO** tab. Under the**GAME SOUND** section, make sure you didn’t mute the game and all the**Volume settings** are toggled to the highest**100** . Then you can try changing**Audio Presets** and see which option gives you luck. (You can start with High Boost.)
