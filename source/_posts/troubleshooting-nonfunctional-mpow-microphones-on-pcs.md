### **Fix 3: Update your audio driver**

 An outdated or corrupted audio driver can also be the root of this issue. To fix it, you just need to update your audio driver to the latest version.

There are two ways to update your sound card driver: **manually**  and **automatically** .

**Update your sound card driver manually**  – You can update your sound card driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your sound card.

 Be sure to choose the driver**that’s compatible with your exact sound card model** and**your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically**  – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

### **Fix 4: Troubleshoot hardware issues**

 If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to troubleshoot hardware issues. You can follow the steps below to troubleshoot hardware issues:

1. Try connecting your Logitech G633 to **another port**  on your computer. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to the next step, below.
2. Try connecting your Logitech G633 to **another computer** . If your mic works on another PC, you should contact the vendor of your PC for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work on another PC, you should contact Logitech for support.
