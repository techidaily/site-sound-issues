 Many players got their mic working in Fortnite by**setting their microphone as the default recording device** on PC. You can follow these steps to try fixing your Fortnite mic not working issue:

1. You need to disable**Voice Chat** in Fortnite first.  
   1. In Fortnite, click the**3 lines** on the top right, then select the**cog icon** to open the settings menu.

2. Close Fortnite.
3. **Right-click** the volume icon in the bottom-right part of your screen, then select **Sounds.** \>>If you are using Windows 11, it will be Settings > System > Sound > More sound settings.

**Note:** You can try**speaking into your microphone** to test if it’s working properly. If it is, you should see a green bar rising next to it while you talk.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf47cf4729b.jpg)

### Method 2: Update your audio driver

 A missing or outdated audio driver may also stop the mic from working in Fortnite. You can try **updating your audio driver** to better troubleshoot the problem.

 There are two ways you can update your audio driver —**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your audio driver manually** — You can update your driver manually by going to the hardware manufacturer’s website and searching for the latest driver for your audio device. But if you take this approach, be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your hardware, and your version of Windows.

**Update your audio driver automatically** — If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**  . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf4e77d496c.jpg)
3. Click**Update** next to any flagged devices to automatically download the correct version of their drivers, then you can install them manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install them all automatically.  (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. You get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5bb0550e404c0.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and check if your mic now works properly in Fortnite. If it doesn’t, contact Driver Easy’s support team at**<support@drivereasy.com>** for further assistance. They’d be happy to help you. Or you can move on to Method 3 below.

### Method 3: Restart the Windows Audio service

 Another solution to your **Fortnite mic not working** problem would be **restarting the Windows Audio service** :

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**services.msc** and click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5baf51cc29fe5.png)
3. Find and right-click on **Windows Audio** , then click **Restart** on the upper left.

### Method 4: Allow apps to access your mic

### Method 5: Check for Windows updates

 If the above methods didn’t work for you, your**Fortnite mic not working** problem is probably being caused by**system issues** . Then, you can check for**Windows updates** .

1. Type**update** in the Windows search box, then press**Enter** .
2. Click**check for updates** in the pop-up window.
3. Install all identified updates to troubleshoot the issue.

**Note:** If you’re using a lower version of Windows,**updating your Window OS to Windows 10** might do the trick, which worked for some Windows 8 users.
