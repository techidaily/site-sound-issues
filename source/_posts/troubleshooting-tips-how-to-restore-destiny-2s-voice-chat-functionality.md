## HyperX Cloud Alpha Mic Not Working? Here's How to Restore Functionality

As a direct follow-up to Cloud II, HyperX Cloud Alpha adds a whole bunch of new and exciting things, and it sounds neutral, dynamic, and clean. If you’re having problems with the HyperX Cloud Alpha microphone, don’t worry. Many users are reporting the same issue, and it can be fixed quickly and easily.

## Try these fixes

* [1. Check the connections](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [2. Troubleshoot the HyperX headset microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [3. Allow access to the microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [4. Update your audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [5. Change your microphone settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

## 1\. Check the connections

 Since HyperX Cloud Alpha comes with a detachable microphone, so it’s important to firmly insert the detachable cable plug to ensure full connectivity (you really need to push it into the headset). Also, make sure not to mute the Mic, and increase the volume to the max level. This is the final fix for many users.

 If you’re using HyperX Cloud Alpha on Xbox One, you’ll need an adapter. Make sure the Mute button is not active, and use the buttons on the adapter to adjust the sound and microphone volume. Then go to**Settings** , and go to**Audio** to make sure the microphone is on. (The Cloud Alpha S is only compatible with PC and PS4.)

3. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait till this gets finished.

## 3\. Allow access to the microphone

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** logo key to invoke the Search box and type **microphone** .
2. Select **Microphone Privacy Settings** from the results list.

3. Under the **Allow Apps To Access Your Microphone** tab, ensure that the toggle is in the **On**  position so that other apps can use your microphone.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/on.jpg)
4. Scroll down to choose which app can access your microphone, and make sure that you have it set for all the apps you want.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![choose apps to allow](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/allow-apps-microphone.jpg)
5. Now check if your mic is working for the app you’re using.

## 4\. Update your audio driver

 If the audio driver is faulty or outdated, you’re likely to encounter the HyperX Cloud Alpha microphone not working problem. To keep your gaming headset work to its best performance, you should install the latest audio driver.

 There are two ways you can update the audio driver: manually or automatically.

**Manually** – You can search for the most recent driver for your sound cards drivers such as[Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/en/downloads) or[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) download the latest driver that is compatible with your Windows version, and install it step by step.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your headset, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

## 5\. Change your microphone settings

 Normally, Windows can automatically detect your microphone and set it as the default input device once your headphone is plugged into. But sometimes you’ll need to set it as the default device manually:

1. Right-click on the sound icon in the lower-right corner of your desktop, and select **Sounds** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/sounds.jpg)
2. Go to the **Recording** tab, and make sure your **Headset Microphone** is set as the default device. If not, select your headphone and click **Set Default** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/c/5597632/398453/3022" target="_top" id="398453"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/3022-398453" border="0" alt="www.sentrypc.com" width="580" height="400"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://sentrypc.7eer.net/i/5597632/398453/3022" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![set as default microphone](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/default.png)
3. Also, make sure it displays your headphone name correctly and shows strong signals. If your headphone is shown as something else, there’s something wrong with your mic settings, so you should re-connect your headset.  
![mic not working wrong settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/no-connection.png)
4. If the display name and signal is normal, right-click **Headset Microphone** and click **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

5. Click the **Levels** tab, then drag the volume slider towards the largest value (100).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/levels.jpg)
6. Click **OK** to apply the changes, and then click **OK** on the last window.

 Now check if your HyperX Cloud Alpha is working now. If not, you can check your game settings to make sure that it is not conflicting with your HyperX mic.
