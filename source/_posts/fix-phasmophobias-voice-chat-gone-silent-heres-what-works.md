## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 This voice chat not working issue may indicate that**the audio driver you’re using is out of date** . If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio driver: [manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and [**automatically**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Option 1: Manually update your audio driver

 To update drivers manually, you can go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the audio card’s website to check for the latest audio driver. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended to go to the PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model or the device model and the specific operating system that you are using.

### Option 2: Automatically update your audio driver (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 It’s a useful tool that will help detect any outdated drivers, then download and install the latest drivers for your system. With Driver Easy, you don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running or risk downloading and installing the wrong driver.
