## IPhone Sound Malfunction? Here’s How to Restore Perfect Stereo Output

In 2016, Apple has released its latest version of iPhone, 7 and 7 Plus, and iOS 10, which is rather exciting for iPhone users. But there have been complains that users are having volume problems with their new iPhone, which in part triggered the new release of iOS 10.0.2 on Sept, 26th. If you are also having problems with your sound or volume of your iPhone, please check the following steps to see if they help. 1) On your iPhone, go to**Settings**, then choose**Sounds**. Then drag the**RINGER AND ALERTS**slider to turn the volume up.

3) Restart your device. If you are with iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, press and hold the power button, which is on the right side of your device. Then press and hold the Volume Down button on the left side to shut down. Then hold both buttons until the screen turns on. 4) Open your music app, then change the volume in Control Panel. 5) Connect a headset. If you can heat sound coming from the headset, remove it and then use a soft, clean and dry brush to clean off the dust or debris in the port. 6) Then go to**Settings**again. Choose**Bluetooth**and then turn it**off**. See if you get the sound back.
