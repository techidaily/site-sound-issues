## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Update your sound card driver automatically (Recommended)

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.

4. Test the audio.

 If the sound problem only happens in a certain application or game, please make sure the audio is configured correctly.

If it does, then you should[contact Astro Support](https://www.astrogaming.com/en-us/support.html) for further troubleshooting steps or have your headset replaced.
