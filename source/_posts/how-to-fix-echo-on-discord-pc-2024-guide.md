## 3\. Update your audio driver

 Whenever you run into audio issues such as the audio is out of sync or cutting out, you need to check whether you’re using a faulty or outdated audio driver. If your audio driver is misconfigured or outdated, you would just hear a crackling or distorted sound and encounter other audio issues. Therefore, you need to update your audio driver as this action may fix your issue immediately.

 You can update your audio driver from the PC or device maker’s support downloads page. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and you need to know the specifications of your PC.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version.

## 4\. Verify integrity of game files

 For Steam games, there is a built-in tool called “verify integrity of game files”. It is a generic troubleshooting step that can help ensure that the installation of a game is up-to-date and if necessary, repair any bad or corrupted game data. When your in-game audio isn’t working properly, it could be a sign that your game files are corrupted or missing. To fix it, you should verify the integrity of game files:

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  
  
![verify integrity of game files Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/outriders-Properties.png)

 2) Select**LOCAL FILES** tab and then click on the**Verify integrity of game files…** button.  
  
![verify integrity of game files Outriders](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/outriders-verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

 Steam will start verifying your game’s files and this may take several minutes. Simply wait for the process to complete.

 Once finished, play Outriders and check if this brings your in-game audio back to a normal state.

## 5\. Disable audio enhancements in Windows

 Audio enhancement packages are aimed to enhance your audio performance. But this feature sometimes causes problems with audio and sound. If you encounter any audio issues, you can try disabling audio enhancements.

Here’s how:

![open sound settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/open-sound-settings.png)
