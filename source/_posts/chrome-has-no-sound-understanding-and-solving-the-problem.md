## Fix 3: Update the sound card driver

 This problem may occur if you are using the wrong audio driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your sound card driver to see if it fixes your problem.

 There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your sound card: manually or automatically.

### Option 1: Update your sound card driver manually

 You can update your sound drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your sound card and searching for the most recent correct sound driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10.

4. Test the audio.

 If the sound problem only happens in a certain application or game, please make sure the audio is configured correctly.

 But your Astro 50 no sound issue persists whatsoever, you can try connecting your headset to another computer and see if it’s working properly. If it does, then you should[contact Astro Support](https://www.astrogaming.com/en-us/support.html) for further troubleshooting steps or have your headset replaced.
