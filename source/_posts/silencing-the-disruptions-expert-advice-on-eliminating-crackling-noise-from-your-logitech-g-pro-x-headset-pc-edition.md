If none of the fixes works for you, it’s time to troubleshoot hardware issues. You can follow the steps below to troubleshoot hardware issues:

1. Try connecting your Logitech G230 to **another port**  on your computer. If the mic works in the other port, it suggests this issue is probably caused by a faulty port, if your mic still doesn’t work, move on to the next step, below.
2. Try connecting your Logitech G230 to **another computer** . If your mic works in another PC, you should contact the vendor of your PC for advice; if your mic still doesn’t work in another PC, you should contact Logitech for support.
